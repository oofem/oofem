Introduction
============

This manual describes in details the format and structure of OOFEM text
input file. Input file can be prepared in any text editor or can be
generated by a conversion program or FEM pre-processor.

.. _running-the-code:

Running the code
----------------

| The program can be executed by typing
| ``oofem [option [parameter]] ...``
| on the command line prompt with the following command line options:

=========== ================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
-v          Prints oofem version.
-f path     Path to oofem input file name, if not present, program interactively reads this parameter.
-r int      Restarts the analysis from given solution step. The corresponding context file (\*.osf) must exist.
-rn         Turns on the equation renumbering. Default is off.
-ar int     Restarts the adaptive computation from given solution step. Requires the corresponding context file (\*.osf) and domain input file (\*.din) to exists. The domain input file describes the new mesh, its syntax is identical to syntax of input file, but it does not contains the output file record, job description record and analysis record.
-l int      Sets treshold for log messages (Errors=0, Warnings=1, Relevant=2, Info=3, Debug=4).
-qo path    Redirect the standard output stream (stdout) to given file.
-qe path    Redirect standard error stream (stderr) to given file.
-c          Forces the creation of context file for each solution step.
-t int      Determines the number of threads to use (requires OpenMP support compiled)
-p          Runs in parallel mode using MPI (requires MPI support compiled)
=========== ================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

| To execute OOFEM program in parallel MPI mode (indicated by the -p flag), users must know the procedure for executing/scheduling MPI jobs on the particular system(s). For instance, when using the MPICH implementation of MPI and many others, the following command initiates a program that uses eight processors:
| ``mpirun -np 8 oofem -p program_options``



Syntax and general rules
------------------------

Input file is composed of records. In the current implementation, each
record is represented by one line in input file. The order of records in
file is compulsory, and it has following structure:

#. output file record, see section OutputFileRecord_,

#. job description record, see section JobDescriptionRecord_,

#. analysis record, see section AnalysisRecord_,

#. domain record, see section DomainRecord_,

#. output manager record, see section OutputManagerRecord_,

#. components size record, see section ComponentsSizeRecord_,

#. node record(s), see section NodeElementSideRecords_,

#. element record(s), see section ElementsRecords_,

#. set record(s), see section SetRecords_,

#. cross section record(s), see section CrossSectionRecords_,

#. material type record(s), see section MaterialTypeRecords_,

#. nonlocal barriers record(s), see section
   NonlocalBarrierRecords_,

#. load, boundary conditions record(s), see section
   LoadBoundaryInitialConditions_,

#. initial conditions record(s), see section
   InitialConditions_,

#. time functions record(s), see section
   TimeFunctionsRecords_.

#. optional xfem manager and associated record(s), see section
   XFEMManagerRecords_

When input line begins with ’#’ character, then it is ignored by the
parser and can serve as a comment inside input file.

The individual records consist of record keyword followed by one or more
attributes. Each attribute is identified by its keyword, which can be
followed by attribute value(s). Some attributes have no values. The
order of attributes in the record is optional.

Sometimes, the record keyword itself can be variable, taking on a
restricted range of possible values. As an example, OOFEM has element
record, desribing particulat element, and record keyword determines the
particular element type. In this case, the record keyword is preceded by
star. We call such record keyword as entity keyword. The possible
substitutions for entity keyword are typed using ``Typewriter`` font
family. Often, some attributes are specific to particular entity
keyword. Then the general format of record is described and entity
specific attributes are described separately. The possible attributes
are then union of general and entity specific attributes.

::

   # nodal records
   Node 1 coords 3 0. 0. 0.
   Node 2 coords 3 0. 0. 2. dofidmask 3 1 2 3
   # element record
   Truss2d 1 nodes 2 1 2 crossSect 1

Each attribute value has a specific type, which describe its size and
layout. To describe the type of an attribute, the following notation is
used: ``Keyword #(type)``, where type determines the attribute type and
# is the placeholder for the attribute value. The possible types of
attribute values are following:

-  **in** - integer number.

   ::

      val1 25

-  **rn** - real number.

   ::

      val2 -0.234e-3

-  **ch** - character (usually for description of unknown type (’d’ for
   displacement, ’t’ for temperature, etc.).

   ::

      val3 t

-  **ia** - integer array. The format of integer array is
   ``size val(1) ... val(size)``, where size, val(1),...,val(size) are
   integer numbers. Values are separated by one or more spaces. As an
   example, consider the integer array attribute called
   ``nodes``\ :math:`=\{1,4,23\}`:

   ::

      nodes 3 1 4 23

-  **ra** - real array. The format of real array is
   ``size val(1) ... val(size)``, where size is integer number and val(1),
   ..., val(size) are real numbers. Values are separated by one or more
   spaces. As an example, consider the real array attribute called
   ``coords``\ :math:`=\{1.0,2.0,3.0\}`:

   ::

      coords 3 1.0 2.0 3.0

-  | **rm** - real matrix, format of real matrix is
   | ``rows columns {val(1,1) val(1,2) ...; val(2,1) ...}``, where “rows”
     and “columns” are integer numbers and val(1,1), ..., are real
     numbers. Columns are seperated by space or comma and lines by
     semicolon. As an example, consider the real matrix attribute called
     :math:`\texttt{mat1}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1.0&-1.0&0.0\\2.0&2.5&5.0\end{array}\right]`:

   ::

      mat1 2 3 \{1.0 -1.0; 0.0 2.0; 2.5 5.0\}

-  **dc** - dictionary. Dictionary consist of pairs, each pair has key
   (character type) and its associated value (integer type). Format of
   dictionary is ``size key(1) val(1) ... key(size) val(size)``, where
   size is integer number, key(1),...,key(size) are single character
   values, and val(1), ..., val(size) are real numbers. Values are
   separated by one or more spaces;

   ::

      dict1 2 a 1.0 v 0.0

-  **rl** - range list. Range list syntax is { number1 .. numberN
   (start1 end1) (start2 end2)}. The enclosing brackets are compulsory.
   The range list represent list of integer values. Single values can be
   specified using single values (number1, .., NumberN). The range of
   values (all numbers from startI to endI including startI and endI can
   be specified using range value in the form (startI endI). The range
   is described using its start and end values enclosed in parenthesis.
   Any number of ranges and single values can be used to specify range
   list.

   ::

      range1 { 1 7 8 (10 20) (25 30) }

-  **et** - entity type. For example, it describes the finite element
   type. Possible type values are mentioned in specific sections.

-  **s** - character string. The string have to be enclosed in quotes
   ("") following after corresponding keyword.

   ::

      string1 ``string example''

-  **expr** - function expression. The expression have to be enclosed in
   quotes (""). The expression is evaluated by internal parser and
   represent mathematical expressions as a function of certain
   variables. The variable names and meaning are described in specific
   sections. The usual arithmetic operators like -,+,*,/ are supported
   and their evaluation order is taken into account. The evaluation
   order can be changed using parenthesis. Several built-in functions
   are supported (sqrt, sin, cos, tan, atan, asin and acos) - these must
   be typed using lowercase letters and their arguments must be enclosed
   in parenthesis.

   ::

      expr1 ``2.0*sin(t)/3.0''

| The general format of record is
| [``attribute1_keyword #(type)``] ``...``
  [``attributeXX_keyword #(type)``]

The keywords and their values are separated by one or more spaces.
Please note, that a single record cooresponds to one input line in input
file.

When some attribute is enclosed in brackets [ ], then it’s use is
optional and often overwrites the default behavior or adds additional
(but optional) information or property (for example adds a loading to
node).

| Example of input record.
| As an example, consider the following record description:
| ``Particle`` ``color #(in)`` ``mass #(rn)`` ``coords #(ra)``
  ``name #(s)``
  The following listing shows the corresponding,
  properly formatted, input record:

::

   Particle 2 color 5 mass 0.18 coords 3 0.0 1.0 2.0 name "P1_36"

Output and Job description Records
==================================

.. _OutputFileRecord:

Output file record
------------------

This record has no keywords and contains a character string, which
describes the path to output file. If the file with the same name
exists, it will be overwritten.

.. _JobDescriptionRecord:

Job description record
----------------------

This record has no keywords and contains a character string, which
describes the job. This description will appear in the output file.

.. _AnalysisRecord:

Analysis record
===============

This record describes the type of analysis, which should be performed.
The analysis record can be splitted into optional meta-step input
records (see below). Then certain attributes originally in analysis
record can be specified independently for each meta-step. This is marked
by adding “M” superscript to keyword. Then the attribute format is
``Keyword^M`` #(type).

The general format of this record can be specified using

-  | “standard-syntax”
   | ``nsteps #(in)`` [``renumber #(in)``]
     [``profileopt #(in)``] ``attributes #(string)``
     [``ninitmodules #(in)``] [``nmodules #(in)``]
     [``nxfemman #(in)``]

-  | “meta step-syntax”
   | ``nmsteps #(in)`` [``ninitmodules #(in)``]
     [``nmodules #(in)``] [``nxfemman #(in)``]
   | immediately followed by ``nmsteps`` meta step records with the
     following syntax:
   | ``nsteps #(in)`` ``attributes #(string)``
   | The ``nmsteps`` parameter determines the number of “metasteps”. The
     meta step represent sequence of solution steps with common
     attributes. There is expected to be ``nmsteps`` subsequent metastep
     records. The meaning of meta step record parameters (or analysis
     record parameters in “standard syntax”) is following:

   -  ``nsteps`` - determines number of subsequent solution steps within
      metastep.

   -  ``renumber`` - Turns out renumbering after each time step.
      Necessary when Dirichlet boundary conditions change during
      simulation. Can also be turned out by the executeable flag
      ``-rn``.

   -  ``profileopt`` - Nonzero value turns on the equation renumbering
      to optimize the profile of characteristic matrix (uses Sloan
      algorithm). By default, profile optimization is not performed. It
      will not work in parallel mode.

   -  ``attributes`` - contains the metastep related attributes of
      analysis (and solver), which are valid for corresponding solution
      steps within meta step. If used in standard syntax, the attributes
      are valid for all solution step.

   -  ``ninitmodules`` - number of initialization module records for
      given problem. The initialization modules are specified after meta
      step section (or after analysis record, if no metasteps are
      present). Initialization modules allow to initialize the state
      variables by values previously computed by external software. The
      available initialization modules are described in section
      InitModulesSec_.

   -  ``nmodules`` - number of export module records for given problem.
      The export modules are specified after initialization modules.
      Export modules allow to export computed data into external
      software for postprocessing. The available export modules are
      described in section ExportModulesSec_.

   -  ``nxfemman`` - 1 implies that an XFEM manager is created, 0
      implies that no XFEM manager is created. The XFEM manager stores a
      list of enrichment items. The syntax of the XFEM manager record
      and related records is described in section
      XFEMManagerRecords_.

   -  ``eetype`` - optional error estimator type used for the problem.
      Used for adaptive analysis, but can also be used to compute and
      write error estimates to the output files. See adaptive
      engineering models for details.

Not all of analysis types support the metastep syntax, and if not
mentioned, the standard-syntax is expected. Currently, supported
analysis types are

-  Linear static analysis, see section LinearStatic_,

-  Eigen value dynamic, see section EigenValueDynamic_,

-  Direct explicit nonlinear dynamics, see section
   NlDEIDynamic_,

-  Direct explicit (linear) dynamics, see section
   DEIDynamic>_,

-  Implicit linear dynamic, see section DIIDynamic_,

-  Incremental **linear** static problem, see section
   IncrementalLinearStatic_,

-  Non-linear static analysis, see section NonLinearStatic_.

Structural Problems
-------------------

.. _StaticStructural:

StaticStructural
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``StaticStructural`` ``nsteps #(in)`` [``deltat #(...)``] [``prescribedtimes #(...)``] [``stiffmode #(...)``] [``nonlocalext #(...)``] [``sparselinsolverparams #(...)``]

Static structural analysis. Can be used to solve linear and nonlinear
static structural problems, supporting changes in boundary conditions
(applied load and supports). The problem can be solved under direct load
or displacement control, indirect control, or by their arbitrary
combination. Note, that the individual solution steps are used to
describe the history of applied incremental loading. The load cases are
not supported, for each load case the new analysis has to be performed.
To analyze linear static problem with multiple load combinations, please
use LinearStatic solver.

By default all material nonlinearities will be taken into account,
geometrical not. To include geometrically nonlinear effect one must
specify level of non-linearity in element records.

The ``sparselinsolverparams`` parameter describes the sparse linear
solver attributes and is explained in section
sparselinsolver_. The optional parameter ``deltat`` defines
the length of time step (equal to 1.0 by default). The times
corresponding to individual solution times can be specified using
optional parameter ``prescribedtimes``, allowing to input array of
discrete solution times, the number of solution steps is then equal to
the size of this array. .

.. _LinearStatic:

Linear static analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``LinearStatics`` ``nsteps #(in)`` [``sparselinsolverparams #(...)``] [``sparselinsolverparams #(...)``]

Linear static analysis. Parameter ``nsteps`` indicates the number of
loading cases. Problem supports multiple load cases, where number of
load cases correspods to number of solution steps, individual load
vectors are formed in individual time-steps. However, the static system
is assumed to be the same for all load cases. For each load case an
auxiliary time-step is generated with time equal to load case number.

The ``sparselinsolverparams`` parameter describes the sparse linear
solver attributes and is explained in section
sparselinsolver_.

.. _LinearStability:

LinearStability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``LinearStability`` ``nroot #(in)`` ``rtolv #(rn)`` [``eigensolverparams #(...)``]

Solves linear stability problem. Only
first ``nroot`` smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will
be computed. Relative convergence tolerance is specified using ``rtolv``
parameter.

The ``eigensolverparams`` parameter describes the sparse linear solver
attributes and is explained in section eigensolverssection_.

.. _EigenValueDynamic:

EigenValueDynamic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``EigenValueDynamic`` ``nroot #(in)`` ``rtolv #(rn)`` [``eigensolverparams #(...)``]

Represents the eigen value dynamic analysis. Only ``nroot`` smallest
eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will be computed. Relative
convergence criteria is governed using ``rtolv`` parameter.

The ``eigensolverparams`` parameter describes the sparse linear solver
attributes and is explained in section eigensolverssection_.

.. _NlDEIDynamic:

NlDEIDynamic
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``NlDEIDynamic`` ``nsteps #(in)`` ``dumpcoef #(rn)`` [``deltaT #(rn)``]

Represents the direct explicit nonlinear dynamic integration. The
central difference method with diagonal mass matrix is used, damping
matrix is assumed to be proportional to mass matrix,
:math:`\boldsymbol{C}
= \mathrm{dumpcoef} * \boldsymbol{M}`, where :math:`\boldsymbol{M}` is
diagonal mass matrix. Parameter ``nsteps`` specifies how many time steps
will be analyzed. ``deltaT`` is time step length used for integration,
which may be reduced by program in order to satisfy solution stability
conditions. Parameter ``reduct`` is a scaling factor (smaller than 1),
which is multiplied with the determined step length adjusted by the
program. If ``deltaT`` is reduced internally, then ``nsteps`` is
adjusted so that the total analysis time remains the same.

| The parallel version has the following additional syntax:
| &\ :math:`\langle`\ [``nonlocalext``]\ :math:`\rangle`\ &

.. _DEIDynamic:

DEIDynamic
~~~~~~~~~~

``DEIDynamic`` ``nsteps #(in)`` ``dumpcoef #(rn)`` [``deltaT #(rn)``]

Represent the **linear** explicit integration scheme for dynamic problem
solution. The central difference method with diagonal mass matrix is
used, damping matrix is assumed to be proportional to mass matrix,
:math:`\boldsymbol{C} = \mathrm{dumpcoef} * \boldsymbol{M}`, where
:math:`\boldsymbol{M}` is diagonal mass matrix. ``deltaT`` is time step
length used for integration, which may be reduced by program in order to
satisfy solution stability conditions. Parameter ``nsteps`` specifies
how many time steps will be analyzed.

.. _DIIDynamic:

DIIDynamic
~~~~~~~~~~

``DIIDynamic`` ``nsteps #(in)`` ``deltaT #(rn)`` ``alpha #(rn)`` ``beta #(rn)`` ``Psi #(rn)``

Represents direct implicit integration of linear dynamic problems.
Damping is modeled as Rayleigh damping :math:`(\boldsymbol{c} =
\rm{alpha}*\boldsymbol{M} + \rm{beta} * \boldsymbol{K})`. Parameter
``Psi`` determines integration method used, for\ ``Psi`` = 1 the Newmark
and for ``Psi`` :math:`\ge` 1.37 the Wilson method will be used.
Parameter ``deltaT`` is required time integration step length.

.. _IncrementalLinearStatic:

IncrementalLinearStatic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``IncrementalLinearStatic`` ``endOfTimeOfInterest #(rn)`` ``prescribedTimes #(ra)``

Represents incremental **linear** static problem. The problem is solved
as series of linear solutions and is intended to be used for solving
linear creep problems or incremental perfect plasticity.

Supports the changes of static scheme (applying, removing and changing
boundary conditions) during the analysis.

Response is computed in times defined by ``prescribedTimes`` array.
These times should include times, when generally the boundary conditions
are changing, and in other times of interest. (For linear creep
analysis, the values should be uniformly distributed on log-time scale,
if no change in loading or boundary conditions). The time at the end of
interested is specified using ``endOfTimeOfInterest`` parameter.

.. _NonLinearStatic:

NonLinearStatic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| **NonLinearStatic**
| Non-linear static analysis. The problem can be solved under direct
  load or displacement control, indirect control, or by their arbitrary
  combination. By default all material nonlinearities will be included,
  geometrical not. To include geometrically nonlinear effect one must
  specify level of non-linearity in element records. There are two
  different ways, how to specify the parameters - the extended and
  standard syntax.

Extended syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The extended syntax uses the “metastep” concept and has the following
format:

``NonLinearStatic`` [``nmsteps #(in)``] ``nsteps #(in)`` [``contextOutputStep #(in)``] [``sparselinsolverparams #(string)``] [``nonlinform #(in)``] <[``nonlocstiff #(in)``]>
<[``nonlocalext``]> <[``loadbalancing``]>

This record
is immediately followed by metastep records with the format described
below. The analysis parameters have following meaning

-  ``nmsteps`` - determines the number of “metasteps”, default is 1.

-  ``nsteps`` - determines number of solution steps.

-  ``contextOutputStep`` - causes the context file to be created for
   every contextOutputStep-th step and when needed. Useful for
   postprocessing.

-  The ``sparselinsolverparams`` parameter describes the sparse linear
   solver attributes and is explained in section
   sparselinsolver_.

-  ``nonlinform`` - formulation of non-linear problem. If == 1
   (default), total Lagrangian formulation in undeformed original shape
   is used (first-order theory). If == 2, the equlibrated displacements
   are added to original ones and updated in each time step
   (second-order theory).

-

| The metastep record has the following general syntax:
| ``nsteps #(in)`` [``controlmode #(in)``] [``deltat #(rn)``]
  [``stiffmode #(in)``] [``refloadmode #(in)``]
  ``solverParams #()`` [``sparselinsolverparams #(string)``]
  [``donotfixload #()``]

where

-  ``controlmode`` - determines the type of solution control used for
   corresponding meta step. if == 0 then indirect control will be used
   to control solution process (arc-length method, default). if == 1
   then direct displacement or load control will be used (Newton-Raphson
   solver). In the later mode, one can apply the prescribed load
   increments as well as control displacements.

-  ``deltaT`` - is time step length. If not specified, it is set equal
   to 1,0. Each solution step has associated the corresponding intrinsic
   time, at which the loading is generated. The ``deltaT`` determines
   the spacing between solution steps on time scale.

-  ``stiffMode`` - If == 0 (default) then tangent stiffness will be used
   at new step beginning and whenever numerical method will ask for
   stiffness update. If == 1 the use of secant tangent will be forced.
   The secant stiffness will be used at new step beginning and whenever
   numerical method will ask for stiffness update. If == 2 then original
   elastic stiffness will be used during the whole solution process.

-  The ``refloadmode`` parameter determines how the reference force load
   vector is obtained from given totalLoadVector and initialLoadVector.
   The initialLoadVector describes the part of loading which does not
   scale. Works only for force loading, other non-force components
   (temperature, prescribed displacements should always given in total
   values). If ``refloadmode`` is 0 (rlm_total, default) then the
   reference incremental load vector is defined as totalLoadVector
   assembled at given time. If ``refloadmode`` is 1 (rlm_inceremental)
   then the reference load vector is obtained as incremental load vector
   at given time.

-  ``solverParams`` - parameters of solver. The solver type is
   determined using ``controlmode``.

-  The ``sparselinsolverparams`` parameter describes the sparse linear
   solver attributes and is explained in section
   sparselinsolver_.

-  By default, reached load at the end of metastep will be maintained in
   subsequent steps as fixed, non scaling load and load level will be
   reset to zero. This can be changed using keyword ``donotfixload``,
   which if present, causes the loading to continue, not resetting the
   load level. For the indirect control the reached loading will not be
   fixed, however, the new reference loading vector will be assembled
   for the new metastep.

| The direct control corresponds to ``controlmode``\ =1 and the
  Newton-Raphson solver is used. Under the direct control, the total
  load vector assembled for specific solution step represents the load
  level, where equilibrium is searched. The implementation supports also
  displacement control - it is possible to prescribe one or more
  displacements by applying “quasi prescribed” boundary
  condition(s) [1]_ The load level then represents the time, where the
  equilibrium has been found. The Newton-Raphson solver parameters
  (``solverParams``) for load-control are:
| ``maxiter #(in)`` [``minsteplength #(in)``]
  [``minIter #(in)``] [``manrmsteps #(in)``] [``ddm #(ia)``]
  [``ddv #(ra)``] [``ddltf #(in)``] [``linesearch #(in)``]
  [``lsearchamp #(rn)``] [``lsearchmaxeta #(rn)``]
  [``lsearchtol #(rn)``] [``nccdg #(in)`` ``ccdg1 #(ia)``
  ``ccdgN #(ia)`` ] ``rtolv #(rn)`` [``rtolf #(rn)``]
  [``rtold #(tn)``] [``initialGuess #(rn)``]  where

-  ``maxiter`` determines the maximum number of iterations allowed to
   reach equilibrium. If equilibrium is not reached, the step length
   (corresponding to time) is reduced.

-  ``minsteplength`` parameter is the minimum step length allowed.

-  ``minIter`` - minimum number of iterations which always proceed
   during the iterative solution.

-  If ``manrmsteps`` parameter is nonzero, then the modified N-R scheme
   is used, with the stiffness updated after ``manrmsteps`` steps.

-  ``ddm`` is array specifying the degrees of freedom, which
   displacements are controlled. Let the number of these DOFs is N. The
   format of ``ddm`` array is 2*N dofman1 idof1 dofman2 idof2 ...
   dofmanN idofN, where the dofmani is the number of i-th dof manager
   and idofi is the corresponding DOF number.

-  ``ddv`` is array of relative weights of controlled displacements, the
   size should be equal to N. The actual value of prescribed dofs is
   defined as a product of its weight and the value of load time
   function specified using ``ddltf`` parameter (see below).

-  ``ddltf`` number of load time function, which is used to evaluate the
   actual displacements of controlled dofs.

-  ``linesearch`` nonzero value turns on line search algorithm. The
   ``lsearchtol`` defines tolerance (default value is 0.8),
   amplification factor can be specified using ``lsearchamp`` parameter
   (should be in interval :math:`(1,10)`), and parameter
   ``lsearchmaxeta`` defines maximum limit on the length of iterative
   step (allowed range is :math:`(1.5,15)`).

-  ``nccdg`` allows to define one or more DOF groups, that are used for
   evaluation of convergence criteria. Each DOF is checked if it is a
   member of particular group and in this case its contribution is taken
   into account when evaluating the convergence criteria for that group.
   By default, if ``nccdg`` is not specified, one group containing all
   DOF types is created. The value of ``nccdg`` parameter defines the
   number of DOF type groups. For each group, the corresponding DOF
   types need to be specified using ``ccdg#`` parameter, where ’#’
   should be replaced by group number (numbering starts from 1). This
   array contains the DofIDItem values, that identify the physical
   meaning of DOFs in the group. The values and their physical meaning
   is defined by DofIDItem enum type (see src/oofemlib/dofiditem.h for
   reference).

-  ``rtolv`` determines relative convergence norm (both for displacement
   iterative change vector and for residual unbalanced force vector).
   Optionally, the ``rtolf`` and ``rtold`` parameters can be used to
   define independent relative convergence crteria for unbalanced forces
   and displacement iterative change. If the default convergence
   criteria is used, the parameters ``rtolv``,\ ``rtolf``, and ``rtold``
   are real values. If the convergence criteria DOF groups are used (see
   bellow the description of ``nccdg`` parameter) then they should be
   specified as real valued arrays of ``nccdg`` size, and individual
   values define relative convergence criteria for each individual dof
   group.

-  ``initialGuess`` is an optional parameter with default vaue 0, for
   which the first iteration of each step starts from the previously
   converged state and applies the prescribed displacement increments.
   This can lead to very high strains in elements connected to the nodes
   with changing prescribed displacements and the state can be far from
   equilibrium, which may results into slow convergence and strain
   localization near the boundary. If ``initialGuess`` is set to 1, the
   contribution of the prescribed displacement increments to the
   internal nodal forces is linearized and moved to the right-hand side,
   which often results into an initial solution closer to equilibrium.
   For instance, if the step is actually elastic, equilibrium is fully
   restored after the second iteration, while the default method may
   require more iterations.

| The indirect solver corresponds to ``controlmode``\ =0 and the CALM
  solver is used. The value of reference load vector is determined by
  ``refloadmode`` parameter mentioned above at the first step of each
  metastep. However, the user must ensure that the same value of
  reference load vector could be obtained for all solution steps of
  particular metastep (this is necessary for restart and adaptivity to
  work). The corresponding meta step solver parameters
  (``solverParams``) are:
| ``Psi #(rn)`` ``MaxIter #(in)`` ``stepLength #(rn)``

  [``rtolf #(rn)``] [``rtold #(rn)``] [``pert #(ia)``]
  [``pertw #(ra)``] [``rpa #(rn)``] [``rseed #(in)``] where

-  ``Psi`` - CALM :math:`\Psi` control parameter. For :math:`\Psi` = 0
   displacement control is applied. For nonzero values the load control
   applies together with displacement control (ALM). For large
   :math:`\Psi` load control apply.

-  ``MaxIter`` - determines the maximum number of iteration allowed to
   reach equilibrium state. If this limit is reached, restart follows
   with smaller step length.

-  ``stepLength`` - determines the maximum value of arc-length (step
   length).

-  ``minStepLength`` - minimum step length. The step length will never
   be smaller. If convergence problems are encountered and step length
   cannot be decreased, computation terminates.

-  ``initialsteplength`` - determines the initial step length (the
   arc-length). If not provided, the maximum step length (determined by
   ``stepLength`` parameter) will be used as the value of initial step
   length.

-  ``forcedInitialStepLength`` - When simulation is restarted, the last
   predicted step length is used. Use ``forcedInitialStepLength``
   parameter to override the value of step length. This parameter will
   also override the value of initial step length set by
   ``initialsteplength`` parameter.

-  ``reqIterations`` - approximate number of iterations controlled by
   changing the step length.

-  ``maxrestarts`` - maximum number of restarting computation when
   convergence not reached up to ``MaxIter``.

-  ``minIter`` - minimum number of iterations which always proceed
   during the iterative solution. ``reqIterations`` are set to be the
   same, ``MaxIter`` are increased if lower.

-  ``manrmsteps`` - Forces the use of accelerated Newton Raphson method,
   where stiffness is updated after ``manrmsteps`` steps. By default,
   the modified NR method is used (no stiffness update).

-  ``hpcmode`` Parameter determining the alm mode. Possible values are:
   0 - (default) full ALM with quadratic constrain and all dofs, 1 -
   (default, if ``hpc`` parameter used) full ALM with quadratic
   constrain, taking into account only selected dofs (see ``hpc``
   param), 2 - linearized constrain in displacements only, taking into
   account only selected dofs with given weight (see ``hpc`` and
   ``hpcw`` parameters).

-  ``hpc`` - Special parameter for Hyper-plane control, when only
   selected DOFs are taken account in ALM step length condition.
   Important mainly for material nonlinear problems with strong
   localization. This array selects the degrees of freedom, which
   displacements are controlled. Let the number of these DOFs be N. The
   format of ``ddm`` array is 2*N dofman1 idof1 dofman2 idof2 ...
   dofmanN idofN, where the dofmani is the number of i-th dof manager
   and idofi is the corresponding DOF number.

-  ``hpcw`` Array of DOF weights in linear constraint. The dof ordering
   is determined by ``hpc`` parameter, the size of the array should be
   N.

-  ``linesearch`` nonzero value turns on line search algorithm. The
   ``lsearchtol`` defines tolerance, amplification factor can be
   specified using ``lsearchamp`` parameter (should be in interval
   :math:`(1,10)`), and parameter ``lsearchmaxeta`` defines maximum
   limit on the length of iterative step (allowed range is
   :math:`(1.5,15)`).

-  ``nccdg`` allows to define one or more DOF groups, that are used for
   evaluation of convergence criteria. Each DOF is checked if it is a
   member of particular group and in this case its contribution is taken
   into account when evaluating the convergence criteria for that group.
   By default, if ``nccdg`` is not specified, one group containing all
   DOF types is created. The value of ``nccdg`` parameter defines the
   number of DOF type groups. For each group, the corresponding DOF
   types need to be specified using ``ccdg#`` parameter, where ’#’
   should be replaced by group number (numbering starts from 1). This
   array contains the DofIDItem values, that identify the physical
   meaning of DOFs in the group. The values and their physical meaning
   is defined by DofIDItem enum type (see src/oofemlib/dofiditem.h for
   reference).

-  ``rtolv`` determines relative convergence norm (both for displacement
   iterative change vector and for residual unbalanced force vector).
   Optionally, the ``rtolf`` and ``rtold`` parameters can be used to
   define independent relative convergence crteria for unbalanced forces
   and displacement iterative change. If the default convergence
   criteria is used, the parameters ``rtolv``,\ ``rtolf``, and ``rtold``
   are real values. If the convergence criteria DOF groups are used (see
   bellow the description of ``nccdg`` parameter) then they should be
   specified as real valued arrays of ``nccdg`` size, and individual
   values define relative convergence criteria for each individual dof
   group.

-  ``pert`` Array specifying DOFs that should be perturbed after the
   first iteration of each step. Let the number of these DOFs be M. The
   format of ``ddm`` array is 2*M dofman1 idof1 dofman2 idof2 ...
   dofmanN idofN, where the dofmani is the number of i-th dof manager
   and idofi is the corresponding DOF number.

-  ``pertw`` Array of DOF perturbations. The dof ordering is determined
   by ``pert`` parameter, the size of the array should be M.

-  ``rpa`` Amplitude of random perturbation that is applied to each DOF.

-  ``rseed`` Seed for the random generator that generates random
   perturbations.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| In this case, all parameters (for analysis as well as for the solver)
  are supplied in analysis record. The default meta step is created for
  all solution steps required. Then the meta step attributes are

Parameter ``lstype`` allows to select the solver for the linear system
of equations. Parameter ``smtype`` allows to select the sparse matrix
storage scheme. The scheme should be compatible with the solver type.

.. _AdaptiveLinearStatic:

Adaptive linear static
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Adaptlinearstatic`` ``nsteps #(in)`` [``sparselinsolverparams #(...)``]
[``meshpackage #(in)``] ``errorestimatorparams #(...)``

Adaptive
linear static analysis. Multiple loading cases are not supported. Due to
linearity of a problem, the complete reanalysis from the beginning is
done after adaptive remeshing. After first step the error is estimated,
information about required density is generated (using mesher interface)
and solution terminates. If the error criteria is not satisfied, then
the new mesh and corresponding input file is generated and new analysis
should be performed until the error is acceptable. Currently, the
available error estimator for linear problems is Zienkiewicz-Zhu. Please
note, that adaptive framework requires specific functionality provided
by elements and material models. For details, see element and material
model manuals.

-  Parameter ``nsteps`` indicates the number of loading cases. Should be
   set to 1.

-  The ``sparselinsolverparams`` parameter describes the sparse linear
   solver attributes and is explained in section
   sparselinsolver_.

-  The ``meshpackage`` parameter selects the mesh package interface,
   which is used to generate information about required mesh density for
   new remeshing. The supported interfaces are explained in section
   meshpackages_. By default, the T3d interface is used.

-  The ``errorerestimatorparams`` parameter contains the parameters of
   Zienkiewicz Zhu Error Estimator. These are described in section
   errorestimators_.

Adaptive nonlinear static
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Adaptnlinearstatic`` ``Nonlinearstaticparams #()`` [``equilmc #(in)``]
[``meshpackage #(in)``] [``eetype #(in)``] ``errorestimatorparams #(...)``

Represents Adaptive Non-LinearStatic problem. Solution is performed as a
series of increments (loading or displacement). The error is estimated
at the end of each load increment (after equilibrium is reached), and
based on reached error, the computation continues, or the new mesh
densities are generated and solution stops. Then the new discretization
should be generated. The truly adaptive approach is supported, so the
computation can be restarted from the last step (see section
running-the-code_), solution is mapped to new mesh (separate
solution step) and new load increment is applied. Of course, one can
start the analysis from the very beginning using new mesh. Currently,
the available estimators/indicators include only linear Zienkiewicz-Zhu
estimator and scalar error indicator. Please note, that adaptive
framework requires specific functionality provided by elements and
material models. For details, see element and material model manuals.

-  Set of parameters ``Nonlinearstaticparams`` are related to nonlinear
   analysis. They are described in section NonLinearStatic_.

-  Parameter ``equilmc`` determines, whether after mapping of primary
   and internal variables to new mesh the equilibrium is restored or not
   before new load increment is applied. The possible values are: 0
   (default), when no equilibrium is restored, and 1 forcing the
   equilibrium to be restored before applying new step.

-  The ``meshpackage`` parameter selects the mesh package interface,
   which is used to generate information about required mesh density for
   new remeshing. The supported interfaces are explained in section
   meshpackages_. By default, the T3d interface is used.

-  Parameter ``eetype`` determines the type of error estimator/indicator
   to be used. The parameters ``errorestimatorparams`` represent set of
   parameters corresponding to selected error estimator. For
   description, follow to section errorestimators_.

.. _FreeWarping:

Free warping analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``FreeWarping`` ``nsteps #(in)``

Free warping analysis computes the deplanation function of cross section
with arbitrary shape. It is done by solving the Laplace’s equation with
automatically generated boundary conditions corresponding to the free
warping problem.

This type of analysis supports only ``TrWarp`` elements and
``WarpingCS`` cross sections. One external node must be defined for each
warping cross section. The coordinates of this node can be arbitrary but
this node must be defined with parametr ``DofIDMask 1 24`` and one
boundary condition which represents relative twist acting on
corresponding warping cross section. No additional loads make sence in
free warping analysis.

Parameter ``nsteps`` indicates the number of loading cases. Series of
loading cases is maintained as sequence of time-steps. For each load
case an auxiliary time-step is generated with time equal to load case
number. Load vectors for each load case are formed as load vectors at
this auxiliary time.

Transport Problems
------------------

.. _StationaryTransport:

Stationary transport problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``StationaryProblem`` ``nsteps #(in)`` [``sparselinsolverparams #(...)``] [``exportfields #(ia)``]

Stationary transport problem. Series of loading cases is maintained as
sequence of time-steps. For each load case an auxiliary time-step is
generated with time equal to load case number. Load vectors for each
load case are formed as load vectors at this auxiliary time. The
``sparselinsolverparams`` parameter describes the sparse linear solver
attributes and is explained in section sparselinsolver_.

If the present problem is used within the context of staggered-like
analysis, the temperature field obtained by the solution can be exported
and made available to any subsequent analyses. For example, temperature
field obtained by present analysis can be taken into account in
subsequent mechanical analysis. To allow this, the temperature must be
“exported”. This can be done by adding array ``exportfields``. This
array contains the field identifiers, which tell the problem to register
its primary unknowns under given identifiers. See file field.h. Then the
subsequent analyses can get access to exported fields and take them into
account, if they support such feature.

.. _TransientTransport:

**Nonlinear** implicit integration scheme for transient transport
problems. The generalized midpoint rule (sometimes called
:math:`\alpha`-method) is used for time discretization, with alpha
parameter, which has limits :math:`0\le\alpha\le1`. For :math:`\alpha=0`
explicit Euler forward method is obtained, for :math:`\alpha=0.5`
implicit trapezoidal rule is recovered, which is unconditionally stable,
second-order accurate in :math:`\Delta t`, and :math:`\alpha=1.0` yields
implicit Euler backward method, which is unconditionally stable, and
first-order accurate in :math:`\Delta t`. ``deltaT`` is time step length
used for integration, ``nsteps`` parameter specifies number of time
steps to be solved. It is possible to define ``dTfunction`` with a
number referring to corresponding time function, see
section TimeFunctionsRecords_. Variable time step is
advantageous when calculating large time intervals.

The ``initT`` sets the initial time for integration, 0. by default. If
``lumped`` is set, then the stabilization of numerical algorithm using
lumped capacity matrix will be used, reducing the initial oscillations.
See section StationaryTransport_ for an explanation on
``exportfields``.

This transport problem supports sets and changes in number of equations.
It is possible to impose/remove Dirichlet boundary conditions during
solution.

``lumpedcapa`` is set, then the stabilization of numerical algorithm
using lumped capacity matrix will be used, reducing the initial
oscillations. See section StationaryTransport_ for an
explanation on ``exportfields``.

This linear transport problem supports changes in number of equations.
It is possible to impose/remove Dirichlet boundary conditions during
solution. This feature is enabled with ``changingProblemSize``, which
ensures storing solution values on nodes (DoFs) directly. If the problem
does not grow/decrease during solution, it is more efficient to use
conventional solution strategy and the parameter should not be
mentioned.

Note: This problem type **requires transport module** and it can be used

``deltaT`` is time step length used for integration, ``nsteps``
parameter specifies number of time steps to be solved. For
``deltaTfunction`` and ``initT`` see
section LinearTransientTransport_. Parameter ``maxiter``
determines the maximum number of iterations allowed to reach equilibrium
(default is 30). Norms of residual physical quantity (heat, mass)
described by solution vector and the change of solution vector are
determined in each iteration. The convergence is reached, when the norms
are less than the value given by ``rtol``. If ``manrmsteps`` parameter
is nonzero, then the modified N-R scheme is used, with the left-hand
side matrix updated after ``manrmsteps`` steps. ``nsmax`` maximum number
of iterations per time step, default is 30. If ``lumpedcapa`` is set,
then the stabilization of numerical algorithm using lumped capacity
matrix will be used, reducing the initial oscillations.

Fluid Dynamic Problems
----------------------

.. _cbsIncomp:

Transient incompressible flow - CBS Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``CBS`` ``nsteps #(in)`` ``deltaT #()`` [``theta1 #(in)``]
[``theta2 #(in)``] [``cmflag #(in)``] [``scaleflag #(in)``
``lscale #(in)`` ``uscale #(in)`` ``dscale #(in)``] [``lstype #(in)``]
[``smtype #(in)``]

Solves the transient incompressible flow using algorithm based on
Characteristics Based Split (CBS, for reference see O.C.Zienkiewics and
R.L.Taylor: The Finite Element Method, 3rd volume,
Butterworth-Heinemann, 2000). At present, only semi-implicit form of the
algorithm is available and energy equation, yielding the temperature
field, is not solved. Parameter ``nsteps`` determines number of solution
steps. Parameter ``deltaT`` is time step length used for integration.
This time step will be automatically adjusted to satisfy integration
stability limits
:math:`\Delta t \le {\frac{h}{\vert\boldsymbol{u}\vert}}` and
:math:`\Delta t \le {\frac{h^2}{2\nu}}`, if necessary. Parameters
``theta1`` and ``theta2`` are integration constants,
:math:`\theta_1, \theta_2 \in \langle{\frac12}, 1\rangle`. If ``cmflag``
is given a nonzero value, then consistent mass matrix will be used
instead of (default) lumped one.

The characteristic equations can be solved in non-dimensional form. To
enable this, the ``scaleflag`` should have a nonzero value, and the
following parameters should be provided: ``lscale``, ``uscale``, and
``dscale`` representing typical length, velocity, and density scales.

Parameter ``lstype`` allows to select the solver for the linear system
of equations. Parameter ``smtype`` allows to select the sparse matrix
storage scheme. The scheme should be compatible with the solver type.
See section sparselinsolver_ for further details.

.. _supgIncomp:

Transient incompressible flow SUPG/PSPG Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SUPG`` ``nsteps #(in)`` ``deltaT #(rn)`` ``rtolv #(rn)``
[``atolv #(rn)``] [``stopmaxiter #(in)``] [``alpha #(rn)``]
[``cmflag #(in)``] [``deltatltf #(in)``] [``miflag #(in)``]
[``scaleflag #(in)`` ``lscale #(in)`` ``uscale #(in)``
``dscale #(in)``] [``lstype #(in)``] [``smtype #(in)``]

Solves the transient incompressible flow using stabilized formulation
based on SUPG and PSPG stabilization terms. The stabilization provides
stability and accuracy in the solution of advection-dominated problems
and permits usage of equal-order interpolation functions for velocity
and pressure. Furthermore, stabilized formulation significantly improves
convergence rate in iterative solution of large nonlinear systems of
equations.

By changing the value :math:`\alpha`, different methods from
“Generalized mid-point family” can be chosen, i.e., Forward Euler
(:math:`\alpha=0`), Midpoint rule (:math:`\alpha=0.5`), Galerkin
(:math:`\alpha=2/3`), and Backward Euler (:math:`\alpha=1`). Except the
first one, all the methods are implicit and require matrix inversion for
solution. Some results form an energy method analysis suggest
unconditional stability for :math:`\alpha\ge 0.5` for the generalized
mid-point family. As far as accuracy is concerned, the midpoint rule is
to be generally preferred.

Parameter ``nsteps`` determines number of solution steps. Parameter
``deltaT`` is time step length used for integration. Alternatively, the
load time function can be used to determine time step length for
particular solution step. The load time function number is determined by
parameter ``deltatltf`` and its value evaluated for solution step number
should yield the step length.

Parameters ``rtolv`` and ``atolv`` allow to specify relative and
absolute errors norms for residual vector. The equilibrium iteration
process will stopped when both error limits are satisfied or when the
number of iteration exceeds the value given by parameter
``stopmaxiter``.

If ``cmflag`` is given a nonzero value, then consistent mass matrix will
be used instead of (default) lumped one.

The algorithm allows to solve the flow of two immiscible fluids in fixed
spatial domain (currently only in 2d). This can be also used for solving
free surface problems, where one of the fluids should represent air. To
enable multi-fluid analysis, user should set parameter ``miflag``. The
supported values are described in
section materialinterfaces_. Please note, that the initial
distribution of reference fluid volume should be provided as well as
constitutive models for both fluids.

The characteristic equations can be solved in non-dimensional form. To
enable this, the ``scaleflag`` should have a nonzero value, and the
following parameters should be provided: ``lscale``, ``uscale``, and
``dscale`` representing typical length, velocity, and density scales.

Parameter ``lstype`` allows to select the solver for the linear system
of equations. Parameter ``smtype`` allows to select the sparse matrix
storage scheme. Please note that the present algorithm leads to a
non-symmetric matrix. The scheme should be compatible with the solver
type. See section sparselinsolver_ for further details.

.. _pfemIncomp:

Transient incompressible flow (PFEM Algorithm)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``PFEM`` ``nsteps #(in)``  ``deltaT #(rn)`` ``material #(in)``
``cs #(in)`` ``pressure #(in)`` [``mindeltat #(rn)``]
[``maxiter #(in)``] [``rtolv #(rn)``] [``rtolp #(rn)``]
[``alphashapecoef #(rn)``] [``removalratio #(rn)``]
[``scheme #(in)``] [``lstype #(in)``] [``smtype #(in)``]

Solves the transient incompressible flow using particle finite element
method based on the Lagrangian formulation of Navier-Stokes equations.

Mesh nodes are represented by
PFEMParticles (see pfemparticles_), which can freely
move and even separate from the main domain. To integrate governing
equations in each solution step, a temporary mesh, built from particles,
is needed. The mesh is rebuilt from scratch in each solution step to
prevent large distortion of elements. Paramters ``cs`` and ``material``
assign types from cross section and material record to created elements.
Thus, the problem is defined without any elements in the input file.

Mesh is generated using Delaunay triangulation and Alpha shape technique
for the identification of the free surface. The parameter
``alphashapecoef`` should reflect initial distribution of PFEMParticles.
Value approximately equal to 1,5-multiple of shortest distance of two
neighboring particles has been found well. On the free surface the
zero-pressure boundary condition is enforced. This must be defined in
boundary condition record under the number defined by ``pressure``.

Parameter ``scheme`` controls whether the equation system for the
components of the auxiliary velocity is solved explicitly (0) or
implicitly (1). The last is the default option.

Parameter ``nsteps`` determines number of solution steps. Parameter
``deltaT`` is time step length used for integration. To ensure numerical
stability, step length is adapted upon mesh geometry and velocity of
paricular nodes. To avoid to short time length a minimal size can be
defined by ``mindeltat``. Alternatively prescribing limit
``removalratio`` of the element edge length too close particles can be
removed from solution.

Optional parameters ``rtolv`` and ``rtolp`` allow to specify relative
norms for velocity and pressure difference of two subsequent iteration
step. Default values are 1.e-8. By default maximal 50 iterations are
performed, if not specified by ``maxiter``.

Parameter ``lstype`` allows to select the solver for the linear system
of equations. Parameter ``smtype`` allows to select the sparse matrix
storage scheme. Please note that the present algorithm leads to a
non-symmetric matrix. The scheme should be compatible with the solver
type. See section sparselinsolver_ for further details.

Coupled Problems
----------------

.. _staggeredproblem:

Staggered Problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``StaggeredProblem`` (``nsteps #(in)`` ``deltaT #(rn))`` :math:`|`
``timeDefinedByProb #(in)`` ``prob1 #(s)`` ``prob2 #(s)``
[``stepMultiplier #(rn)``]

Represent so-called staggered analysis. This can be described as an
sequence of sub-problems, where the result of some sub-problem in the
sequence can depend on results of previous sub-problems in sequence.
Typical example is heat transfer analysis followed by mechanical
analysis taking into account the temperature field generated by the heat
transfer analysis. Similar analysis can be done when coupling moisture
transport with concrete drying strain.

The actual implementation supports only sequence of two sub-problems.
The sub-problems are described using sub-problem input files. The syntax
of sub-problem input file is the same as for standalone problem. The
only addition is that sub-problems should export their solution fields
so that they became available for subsequent sub-problems. See the
Section StationaryTransport_.

The subproblem input files are described using ``prob1`` and ``prob2``
parameters, which are strings containing a path to sub-problem input
files, the ``prob1`` contains input file path of the first sub-problem,
which runs first for each solution step, the ``prob2`` contains input
file path of the second sub-problem.

There are two options how to control a time step sequence. The first
approach uses ``timeDefinedByProb`` which uses time sequence from the
corresponding subproblem. The subproblem may specify arbitrary loading
steps and allows high flexibility. The second approach uses the
staggered problem to take control over time. Therefore any sub-problem
time-stepping parameters are ignored (even if they are required by
sub-problem input syntax) and only staggered-problem parameters are
relevant. ``deltaT`` is than a time step length used for integration,
``nsteps`` parameter specifies number of time steps to be solved.
``stepMultiplier`` multiplies all times with a given constant. Default
is 1.

Note: This problem type **is included in transport module** and it can
be used only when this module is configured. Note: All material models
derived from StructuralMaterial base will take into account the external
registered temperature field, if provided.

.. _fluidstructureproblem:

FluidStructure Problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``FluidStructureProblem``  ``nsteps #(in)`` ``deltaT #(rn)`` ``prob1 #(s)``
``prob2 #(s)`` [``maxiter #(in)``] [``rtolv #(rn)``]
[``rtolp #(rn)``]

Represents a fluid-structure analysis based on StaggeredProblem but
providing iterative synchronization of sub-problems. The implementation
uses the the PFEM model pfemIncomp_ for the fluid part.
For the structural part a full dynamic analysis using implicit direct
integration DIIDynamic DIIDynamic_ is considered.

The coupling of both phases is based on the idea of enforcing
compatibility on the interface. Special fluid particle are attached to
every structural node on the interface that can be hit by the fluid.
These special particles have no degrees of freedom associated, so no
equations are solved on them. However, their movement is fully
determined by associated structural nodes. Their velocities governed by
the solid part affect the fluid equation naturally.

This iterative procedure is based on the so-called Dirichlet-Neumann
approach. Dirichlet boundary conditions are the prescribed velocities on
the fluid side of the interface, whereas applied forces on the
structural side represent the Neumann boundary conditions.

The convergence criterion is based on the difference of the pressure and
velocity values on the interface from the subsequent iterative steps.
Once they are smaller than prescribed tolerance, the iteration is
terminated and solution can proceed to the next step.

The subproblem input files are described using ``prob1`` and ``prob2``
parameters, which are strings containing a path to sub-problem input
files, the ``prob1`` contains input file path of the first sub-problem,
which runs first for each solution step, the ``prob2`` contains input
file path of the second sub-problem. The time step sequence is
controlled by the number of steps ``nsteps`` and the time step length
``deltaT``.

Optional parameters ``rtolv`` and ``rtolp`` allow to specify relative
norms for velocity and pressure differnce of two subsequent iteration
step. Default values are 1.e-3. By default maximal 50 iterations are
performed, if not specified by ``maxiter``.

Note: This problem type **is included in PFEM module** and it can be
used only when this module is configured.

.. _DomainRecord:

Domain record(s)
================

This set of records describes the whole domain and its type. Depending
on the type of problem, there may be one or several domain records. If
not indicated, one domain record is default for all problem types.

| The domain type is used to resolve the default number of DOFs in node
  and their physical meaning. Format is following
| ``domain`` ``domainType``
| The ``domainType`` can be one from the following

-  The ``2dPlaneStress`` and ``2d-Truss`` modes declare two default dofs
   per node (u-displacement, v-displacement),

-  The ``3d`` mode declares three default dofs per node (u-displacement,
   v-displacement, w-displacement),

-  The ``2dMindlinPlate`` mode declares three default dofs per node
   (w-displacent, u-rotation, v-rotation). Strain vector contains
   :math:`\kappa_{xx}`, :math:`\kappa_{yy}`, :math:`\kappa_{xy}`,
   :math:`\gamma_{xz}`, :math:`\gamma_{yz}`. Stress vector contains
   :math:`m_{xx}`, :math:`m_{yy}`, :math:`m_{xy}`, :math:`q_{xz}`,
   :math:`q_{yz}`.

-  The ``3dShell`` mode declares six default dofs per node (displacement
   and rotation along each axis).

-  The ``2dBeam`` mode declares three default dofs per node
   (u-displacement, w-displacement, v-rotation).

-  The ``2dIncompFlow`` mode declares three default dofs per node
   (u-velocity, v-velocity, and pressure). The default number of dofs
   per node as well as their physical meaning can be overloaded in
   particular dof manager record (see section
   NodeElementSideRecords_).

   The further records describe particular domain components -
   OutputManagers, DofManagers, Elements, CrossSection models, Material
   Models, Boundary and Initial Conditions and Load time functions.

.. _OutputManagerRecord:

Output manager record
---------------------

| The output manager controls output. It can filter output to specific
  solution steps, and within these selected steps allows also to filter
  output only to specific dof managers and elements. The format of
  output manager record is
| [``tstep_all``] [``tstep_step #(in)``] [``tsteps_out #(rl)``]
  [``dofman_all``] [``dofman_output #(rl)``]
  [``dofman_except #(rl)``] [``element_all``]
  [``element_output #(rl)``] [``element_except #(rl)``]

| To select all solution steps, in which output will be performed, use
  ``tstep_all``. To select each ``tstep_step``-nth step, use
  ``tstep_step`` parameter. In order to select only specific solution
  steps, the ``tsteps_out``\ list can be specified, supplying solution
  step number list in which output will be done. The combination of
  ``tstep_step`` and ``tsteps_out`` parameters is allowed.

| Output manager allows also to filter output to only specific dof
  managers and elements. If these specific members are selected, the
  output happens only in selected solution steps. The ``dofman_all`` and
  ``element_all`` parameters select all dof managers or elements
  respectively. Parameter arrays ``dofman_output`` and
  ``element_output`` allow to select only specific members. Numbers of
  selected members are then contained in ``dofman_output`` or
  ``element_output`` lists respectively. The previously selected members
  can be explicitly de-selected by specifying their component numbers in
  ``dofman_except`` or ``element_except`` lists. A few examples:
| ``dofman_output {1 3}``  prints nodes 1,3
| ``dofman_output {(1 3)}``  prints nodes 1,2,3
| ``element_output {1 3}``  prints elements 1,3
| ``element_output {(1 3)}``  prints elements 1,2,3
| ``element_output {(1 3) 5 6}``  prints elements 1,2,3,5,6

.. _ComponentsSizeRecord:

Components size record
----------------------

| This record describes the number of components in related domain. The
  particular records will follow immediately in input file. The general
  format is:
| ``ndofman #(in)`` ``nelem #(in)``
  ``ncrosssect #(in)`` ``nmat #(in)`` ``nbc #(in)``
  ``nic #(in)`` ``nltf #(in)`` [``nbarrier #(in)``]
   where
  ``ndofman`` represents number of dof managers (e.g. nodes) and their
  associated records, ``nelem`` represents number of elements and their
  associated records, ``ncrosssect`` is number of cross sections and
  their records, ``nmatdnMat`` is number of material models and their
  records, ``nbc`` represents number of boundary conditions (including
  loads) and their records, ``nic`` parameter determines the number of
  initial conditions, and ``nltf`` represents number of time functions
  and their associated records. The optional parameter ``nbarrier``
  represents the number of nonlocal barriers and their records. If not
  specified, no barriers are assumed.

.. _NodeElementSideRecords:

Dof manager records
-------------------

These records describe individual DofManager records (i.e. nodes or
element sides (if they manage some DOFs)). The general format is
following:

``DofManagerType`` ``#(in)`` [``load #(ra)``] [``DofIDMask #(ia)``]
[``bc #(ia)``] [``ic #(ia)``] [``doftype #(ia)``
``masterMask #(ia)``]  <[``shared``]>
:math:`|` <[``remote``]> :math:`|` <[``null``]>
<[``partitions #(ia)``]>

The order
of particular records is optional, the dof manager number is determined
by (``#(in)`` parameter. The numbering of individual dof managers
is arbitrary, it could be even non-continuous. In this context, one
could think of dof manager number as a label that is assigned to
individual dof manager and by which the dof manager is referenced.

By default, the nodal DOFs are determined by asking all the connected
elements. Specifying additional dofs can be done using the using the
``DofIDMask`` array which determines their physical interpretation. Each
item of ``DofIDMask`` array describes the physical meaning of
corresponding DOF in dof manager. Currently the following values are
supported: {u-displacement=1, v-displacement=2, w-displacement=3,
u-rotation=4, v-rotation=5, w-rotation=6, u-velocity=7, v-velocity=8,
w-velocity=9, temperature=10, pressure=11, special dofs for
gradient-type constitutive models=12 and 13, mass concentration=14,
special dofs for extended finite elements (XFEM)=15–30}. **It is not
allowed to have two DOFs with the same physical meaning in the same
DofManager.**

The applied primary (Dirichlet) boundary conditions are specified using
"bc" record, while natural boundary conditions using "load" parameter.

-  The size of "bc" array (primary bc) should be equal to number of DOFs
   in dof manager and i-th value relates to i-th DOF - the ordering and
   physical meaning of DOFs is determined by domain record and can be
   optionally specified for each dof manager individually (see next
   paragraph). The values of this array are corresponding boundary
   condition record numbers or zero, if no primary bc is applied to
   corresponding DOF. The compatible boundary condition type are
   required: primary conditions require "BoundaryCondition" records.

-  The load "array" contains record numbers of natural boundary
   conditions that are applied. The required record type for natural
   condition is "NodalLoad". The actual value is the summation of all
   contributions, if more than one natural bc is applied. See section on
   boundary conditions for the syntax. Please note, that the values of
   natural bc for individual DOFs are specified in its record, not in
   dofmanager record.

By default, if "bc" and/or "load" parameters are omitted, no primary
and/or natural bc are applied. Analogously, initial conditions are
represented using ``ic`` array. The size of ``ic`` array should be equal
to number of DOFs in dof manager. The values of this array are
corresponding initial condition record numbers or zero, if no initial
condition is applied to corresponding DOF (in this case zero value is
assumed as value of initial condition).

Parameters ``dofType`` and ``masterMask`` allows to connect some dof
manager’s dofs (so-called “slave” dofs) to corresponding dof (according
to their physical meaning) of another dof manager (so-called “master”
dof). The master slave principle allows for example simple modeling of
structure hinges, where multiple elements are connected by introducing
multiple nodes (with same coordinates) sharing the same displacement
dofs and each one possessing their own rotational dofs. Parameter
``dofType`` determines the type of (slave) dof to create. Currently
supported values are 0 for master DOF, 1 for simpleSlave DOF (linked to
another single master DOF), and 2 for general slave dof, that can depend
on different DOFs belonging to different dof managers. If ``dofType`` is
not specified, then by default all DOFs are created as master DOFs. If
provided, masterMask is also required. The meaning of ``masterMask``
parameter is depending on type of particular dofManager, and will be
described in corresponding sections.

Supported DofManagerType keywords are

-  Node record

   | ``Node`` ``coords #(ra)`` [``lcs #(ra)``]
   | Represent an abstraction for finite element node. The node
     coordinates in space (given by global coordinate system) are
     described using ``coords`` attribute. This array contains x, y and
     possibly z (depends on problem under consideration) coordinate of
     node. By default, the coordinate system in node is global
     coordinate system. User defined local coordinate system in node is
     described using ``lcs`` array. This array contains six numbers,
     where the first three numbers represent a directional vector of the
     local x-axis, and the next three numbers represent a directional
     vector of the local y-axis. The local z-axis is determined using a
     vector product. A right-hand coordinate system is assumed. If user
     defined local coordinate system in node is specified, then the
     boundary conditions and applied loading are specified in this local
     coordinate system. The reactions and displacements are also in
     ``lcs`` system at the output.

   The node can create only master DOFs and SimpleSlave DOFs, so the
   allowable values of ``dofType`` array are in range 0,1. For the Node
   dof manager, the ``masterMask`` is the array of size equal to number
   of DOFs, and the i-th value determines the master dof manager, to
   which i-th dof is directly linked (the dof with same physical meaning
   are linked together). The local coordinate system in node with same
   linked dofs is supported, but it should be exactly the same as on
   master.

-  Rigid arm record

   | ``RigidArmNode`` ``coords #(ra)`` ``master #(in)``
     [``masterMask #(ia)``] [``lcs #(ra)``]
   | Represent node connected to other node (called master) using rigid
     arm. Rigid arm node DOFs can be linked to master (via rigid arm
     transformation) or can be independent. The rigid arm node allows to
     avoid very stiff elements used for modelling the rigid-arm
     connection. The rigid arm node maps its dofs to master dofs using
     simple transformations (small rotations are assumed). Therefore,
     the contribution to rigid arm node can be localized directly to
     master related equations. The rigid arm node can not have its own
     boundary or initial conditions, they are determined completely from
     master dof conditions. Currently it is possible to map only certain
     dofs - see ``dofType``. Linked DOFs should have dofType value equal
     to 2, non-linked (primary) DOFs 0.

   Rigid arm node can be loaded independently of master. The node
   coordinates in space (given by global coordinate system) are
   described using ``coords`` field. This array contains x, y and
   possibly z (depends on problem under consideration) coordinate of
   node. The ``master`` parameter is the master node number, to which
   rigid arm node dofs are mapped. The rigid arm node and master can
   have arbvitrary local coordinate systems (if not specified, global
   one is assumed).

   The optional parameter ``masterMask`` allows to specify how
   particular mapped DOF depends on master DOFs. The size of
   ``masterMask`` array should be equal to number of DOFs. For all
   linked DOFs (with corresponding dofType value equal to 2) the
   corresponding value of ``masterMask`` array should be 1.

   The local coordinate system in rigid arm node is supported, the
   coordinate system in master and slave can be different. If no lcs is
   set, global one is assumed.the global cs applies.

-  Hanging node

   ``HangingNode`` ``coords #(ra)`` ``dofType #(in)``
   [``masterElement #(in)``] [``masterRegion #(in)``]

   Hanging node is connected to an a master element using generalized
   interpolation. Hanging node posses no degrees of freedom (except
   unlined dofs) - all values are interpolated from corresponding master
   elements and its DOFs. arbitrary FE mesh of concrete specimen or to
   facilitate the local refinement of FE mesh. The hanging nodes can be
   in a chain.

   The contributions of hanging node are localized directly to master
   related equations. The hanging node can have its own boundary or
   initial conditions, but only for primary unlinked DOFs. For linked
   DOFs, these conditions are determined completely from master DOF
   conditions. The local coordinate system should be same for all master
   nodes. The hanging node can be loaded independently of its master.

   Values of array ``dofType`` can have following values: 0-primary DOF,
   2-linked DOF.

   The value of ``masterElement`` specifies the element number to which
   the hanging node is attached. The node can be attached to any
   arbitrary coordinate within the master element. The element must
   support the necessary interpolation classes. The same interpolation
   for unknowns and geometry is assumed.

   The no (or -1) value for ``masterElement`` is supplied, then the node
   will locate the element closest to its coordinate. If no (or zero)
   value for ``masterRegion`` is supplied, then all regions will be
   searched, otherwise only the elements in cross section with number
   ``masterRegion``. If ``masterElement`` is directly supplied
   ``masterRegion`` is unused.

-  Slave node

   ``SlaveNode``  ``coords #(ra)``  ``dofType #(in)``
   ``masterDofMan #(ia)``  ``weights #(ra)``

   Works identical to hanging node, but the weights (``weights``) are
   not computed from any element, but given explicitly, as well as the
   connected dof managers (``masterDMan``).

-  Element side

   | ``ElementSide``
   | Represents an abstraction for element side, which holds some
     unknowns.

.. _pfemparticles:  

-  PFEMParticle

   | ``PFEMParticle`` ``coords #(ra)``
   | Represent the particle used in PFEM analysis.

.. _interactionparticle:
   
-  InteractionPFEMParticle 

   | ``InteractionPFEMParticle`` ``coords #(ra)`` ``bc #(ia)``
     ``coupledNode #(in)``
   | Represent a special particle used in the PFEM-part of the
     FluidStructureProblem. The particle is attached to ``coupledNode``
     from the structural counter part.
     InteractionBoundaryCondition (see  interactionbc_)
     must be prescribed under ``bc`` to access the velocities from solid
     nodes.

.. _ElementsRecords:

Element records
---------------

These records specify a description of particular elements. The general
format is following:

``ElementType`` ``#(in)`` ``mat #(in)`` ``crossSect #(in)``
``nodes #(ia)`` [``bodyLoads #(ia)``] [``boundaryLoads #(ia)``]
[``activityltf #(in)``] [``lcs #(ra)``]
<[``partitions #(ia)``]> <[``remote``]>

The order of element records is optional, the element number is
determined by ``#(in)`` parameter. The numbering of individual
elements is arbitrary, it could be even non-continuous. In this context,
one could think of element number as a label that is assigned to
individual elements and by which the element is referenced.

Element material is described by parameter ``mat``, which contains
corresponding material record number. Element cross section is
determined by cross section with ``crossSect`` record number. Element
dof managers (nodes, sides, etc.) defining element geometry are
specified using ``nodes`` array.

Body load acting on element is specified using ``bodyLoads`` array.
Components of this array are corresponding load record numbers. The
loads should have the proper type (body load type), otherwise error will
be generated.

Boundary load acting on element boundary is specified using
``boundaryLoads`` array. The format of this array is

.. math:: 2\cdot size \; lnum(1)~id(1)~\dots~lnum(size)~id(size),

where :math:`size` is total number of loadings applied to element,
:math:`lnum(i)` is the applied load number, and :math:`id(i)` is the
corresponding entity number, to which the load is applied (for example a
side or a surface number). The entity numbering is element dependent and
is described in element specific sections. The applied loads must be of
proper type (boundary load type), otherwise error is generated.

The support for element insertion and removal during the analysis is
provided. One can specify optional time function (identified by its id
using ``activityltf`` parameter). The nonzero value of this time
function indicates, whether the element is active (nonzero value, the
default) or inactive (zero value) at particulat solution step. Tested
for structural and transport elements. This feature allows considering
temperature evolution of layered casting of concrete, where certain
layers needs to be inactive before they are cast. See a corresponding
example in oofem tests how to enforce hydrating material model, boundary
conditions and element activity acting concurrently.

Orientation of local coordinates can be specified using ``lcs`` array.
This array contains six numbers, where the first three numbers represent
a directional vector of local x-axis, and the next three numbers
represent a directional vector of local y-axis. The local z-axis is
determined using the vector product. The ``lcs`` array on the element is
particularly useful for modeling of orthotropic materials which follow
the element orientation. On a beam or truss element, the ``lcs`` array
has no effect and the 1D element orientation is aligned with the global
:math:`xx` component.

Available material models, their outline and corresponding parameters
are described in separate **Element Library Manual.**

.. _SetRecords:

Set records
-----------

Sets specify regions of the geometry as a combination of volumes,
surfaces, edges, and nodes. The main usage of sets are to connect
regions of elements to a given cross section or apply a boundary
condition, though sets can be used for many other things as well.

``Set`` ``#(in)`` [``elements #(ia)``] [``elementranges #(rl)``]
[``allElements``] [``nodes #(ia)``] [``noderanges #(rl)``] [``allNodes``]
[``elementboundaries #(ia)``] [``elementedges #(ia)``]

Volumes (elements) and nodes can be specified using either a list,
``elements``, ``nodes``, or with a range list ``elementranges``,
``noderanges``. Edges ``elementedges``, and surfaces
``elementboundaries``, are specified in a interleaved list, every other
number specifying the element, and edge/surface number (the total length
of the list being twice the number of surfaces/edges). The internal
numbering of edges/surfaces is available in the **Element Library
Manual**.

Note that edge loads (singular loads given in “newton per length” (or
equivalent), should be applied to ``elementedges``, surface loads
“newton per area” on ``elementboundaries``, and bulk loads “newton per
volume” on ``elements``.

Example 1: A deadweight (gravity) load would be applied to the
``elements`` in a set, while a distributed line load would be applied to
the midline “edge” of the beam element, thus should be applied to a
``elementedges`` set. In the latter case, the midline of the beam is
defined as the first (and only) “edge” of the beam.

Example 2: Axisymmetric structural element analysis: A deadweight load
would be applied to ``elements`` in a set. A external pressure would be
defined as a surface load an be applied to the ``elementboundaries`` in
a set. The element integrates the load (analytically) around the axis,
so the load would still count as a surface load.

.. _CrossSectionRecords:

Cross section records
---------------------

These records specify a cross section model descriptions. The general
format is following:

``CrossSectType`` ``#(in)``

The order of particular cross section records is optional, cross section
model number is determined by ``#(in)`` parameter. The numbering
should start from one and should end at n, where n is the number of
records.

The crossSectType keyword can be one from following possibilities

-  | Integral cross section with constant properties
   | ``SimpleCS`` [``thick #(rn)``] [``width #(rn)``] [``area #(rn)``]
     [``iy #(rn)``] [``iz #(rn)``] [``ik #(rn)``]
     [``shearareay #(rn)``] [``shearareaz #(rn)``]
     ``beamshearcoeff #(rn)``
   | Represents integral type of cross section model. In current
     implementation, such cross section is described using cross section
     thick (``thickVal``) and width (``widthVal``). For some problems
     (for example 3d), the corresponding volume and cross section
     dimensions are determined using element geometry, and then you can
     omit some (or all) parameters (refer to documentation of individual
     elements for required cross section properties). Parameter ``area``
     allows to set cross section area, parameters ``iz``, ``iz``, and
     ``ik`` represent inertia moment along y and z axis and Saint-Venant torsional
     constant. Parameter ``beamshearcoeff`` allows to set shear
     correction factor, or equivalent shear areas (``shearareay`` and
     ``shearareaz`` parameters) can be provided. These cross section
     properties are assumed to be defined in local coordinate system of
     element.

-  | Integral cross section with variable properties
   | ``VariableCS`` [``thick #(expr)``] [``width #(expr)``] [``area #(expr)``]
     [``iy #(expr)``] [``iz #(expr)``] [``ik #(expr)``]
     [``shearareay #(expr)``] [``shearareaz #(expr)``]
   | Represents integral type of cross section model, where individual
     cross section parameters can be expressed as an arbitrary function
     of global coordinates x,y,z. Similar to SimpleCS, for some problems
     (for example 3d), the corresponding volume and cross section
     dimensions are determined using element geometry, then you can omit
     many (or some) parameters (refer to documentation of individual
     elements for required cross section properties). Parameter ``area``
     allows to set cross section area, parameters ``iz``, ``iz``, and
     ``ik`` represent inertia moment along y and z axis and Saint-Venant torsional
     constant. Parameters (``shearareay`` and ``shearareaz``
     determine shear area, which is required by beam and plate elements.
     All cross section properties are assumed to be defined in local
     coordinate system of element.

-  | Layered cross section
   | ``LayeredCS`` ``nLayers #(in)`` ``LayerMaterials #(ia)``
     ``Thicks #(ra)`` ``Widths #(ra)``  ``midSurf #(rn)``
   | Represents the layered cross section model, based on geometrical
     hypothesis, that cross sections remain planar after deformation.
     Number of layers is determined by ``nLayers`` parameter. Materials
     for each layer are specified by ``LayerMaterials`` array. For each
     layer is necessary to input geometrical characteristic, thick -
     using ``Thicks`` array, and width - using ``Widths`` array.
     Position of mid surface is determined by its distance from bottom
     of cross section using ``midSurf`` parameter (normal and momentum
     forces are then computed with regard to it’s position). Elements
     using this cross section model must implement layered cross section
     extension. For information see element library manual.

-  | Fibered cross section
   | ``FiberedCS`` ``nfibers #(in)`` ``fibermaterials #(ia)``
     ``thicks #(ra)`` ``widths #(ra)`` ``thick #(rn)``
     ``width #(rn)`` ``fiberycentrecoords #(ra)``
     ``fiberzcentrecoords #(ra)``
   | Cross section represented as a set of rectangular fibers. It is
     based on geometrical hypothesis, that cross sections remain planar
     after deformation (3d generalization of layered approach for
     beams). Paramater ``nfibers`` determines the number of fibers that
     together form the overall cross section. The model requires to
     specify a material model corresponding to particular fiber using
     ``fibermaterials`` array. This array should contain for each fibre
     corresponding material model number (the material model specified
     on element level has no meaning in this particular case). **The
     geometry of cross section is determined from fiber dimensions and
     fiber positions, all input in local coordinate system of the beam
     (yz plane).** The thick and width of each fiber are determined
     using ``thicks`` and ``widths`` arrays. The overall thick and width
     are specified using parameters ``thick`` and ``width``. Positions
     of particular fibers are specified by providing coordinates of
     center of each fiber using ``fiberycentrecoords`` array for
     y-coordinates and ``fiberzcentrecoords`` array for z-coordinates.

-  | Warping cross section
   | ``WarpingCS`` ``WarpingNode #(in)``
   | Represents the cross section for Free warping analysis, see section
     FreeWarping_. The ``WarpingNode`` parametr defines the
     number of external node with prescribed boundary condition which
     corresponds to the relative twist of warping cross section.

.. _MaterialTypeRecords:

Material type records
---------------------

These records specify a material model description. The general format
is following:

``MaterialType`` ``#(in)`` ``d #(rn)``

The order of particular material records is optional, the material
number is determined by ``#(in)`` parameter. The numbering should
start from one and should end at n, where n is the number of records.
Material density is compulsory parameter and it’s value is given by
``d`` parameter.

Available material models, their outline and corresponding parameters
are described in separate **Material Library Manual**.

.. _NonlocalBarrierRecords:

Nonlocal barrier records
------------------------

Nonlocal material models of integral type are based on replacement of
certain suitable local quantity in local constitutive law by their
nonlocal counterparts, that are obtained as weighted average over some
characteristic volume. The weighted average is computed as a sum of a
remote value multiplied by weight function value. The weight function
typically depend on a distance between remote and receiver points and
decreases with increasing distance. In some cases, it is necessary to
disregard mutual interaction between some points (for example if they
are on the opposite sides of a thin notch, which prevents the nonlocal
interactions to take place). The barriers are the way how to introduce
these constrains. The barrier represent a curve (in 2D) or surface (in
3D). When the line connecting receiver and remote point intersects a
barrier, the barriers is activated and the corresponding interaction is
not taken into account.

Currently, the supported barrier types are following:

-  Polyline barrier

   | ``polylinebarrier`` ``#(in)`` ``vertexnodes #(ia)`` [``xcoordindx #(in)``]
     [``ycoordindx #(in)``]
   | This represents a polyline barrier for 2D problems. Barrier is a
     polyline, defined as a sequence of nodes representing vertices. The
     vertices are specified using parameter ``vertexnodes`` array, which
     contains the node numbers. The optional parameters ``xcoordindx``
     and ``ycoordindx`` allow to select the plane (xy, yz, or xz), where
     the barrier is defined. The ``xcoordindx`` is the first coordinate
     index, ``ycoordindx`` is the second. The default values are 1 for
     ``xcoordindx`` and 2 for ``ycoordindx``, representing barrier in xy
     plane.

-  Symmetry barrier

   | ``symmetrybarrier`` ``#(in)`` ``origin #(ra)`` ``normals #(ra)``
     ``activemask #(ia)``
   | Implementation of symmetry barier, that allows to specify up to
     three planes (orthogonal ones) of symmetry. This barrier allows to
     model the symmetry of the averaged field on the boundary without
     the need of modeling the other part of structure across the plane
     of symmetry. It is based on modifying the integration weights of
     source points to take into account the symmetry. The potential
     symmetry planes are determined by specifying orthogonal
     right-handed coordinate system, where axes represent the normals of
     corresponding symmetry planes. Parameter ``origin`` determines the
     origin of the coordinate system, the ``normals`` array contains
     three components of x-axis direction vector, followed by three
     components of y-axis direction vector (expressed in global
     coordinate system). The z-axis is determined from the orthogonality
     conditions. Parameter ``activemask`` allows to specify active
     symmetry planes; i-th nonzero value activates the symmetry barrier
     for plane with normal determined by corresponding coordinate axis
     (x=1, y=2, z=3).

.. _LoadBoundaryInitialConditions:

Load and boundary conditions
----------------------------

These records specify description of boundary conditions. The general
format is following:

``EntType`` ``#(in)`` ``loadTimeFunction #(in)`` [``valType #(in)``]
[``dofs #(ia)``] [``isImposedTimeFunction #(in)``]

The order of particular records is optional, boundary condition number
is determined by ``#(in)`` parameter. The numbering should start
from one and should end at n, where n is the number of records. Time
function value (given by ``loadTimeFunction`` parameter) is a
multiplier, using which each component (value of loading or value of
boundary condition) describes its time variation. The optional parameter
``valType`` allows to determine the physical meaning of bc value, which
is sometimes required. Supported values are (1 - temperature, 2 -
force/traction, 3 - pressure, 4 - humudity, 5 - velocity, 6 -
displacement). Another optional parameter ``dofs`` is used to determine
which dofs the boundary condition should act upon. It is not relevant
for all BCs..

The nonzero value of ``isImposedTimeFunction`` time function indicates
that given boundary condition is active, zero value indicates not active
boundary condition in given time (the bc does not exist). By default,
the boundary condition applies at any time.

Currently, EntType keyword can be one from

-  Dirichlet boundary condition

   ``BoundaryCondition`` ``prescribedvalue #(rn)`` [``d #(rn)``]

   Represents boundary condition. Prescribed value is specified using
   ``prescribedvalue`` parameter. The physical meaning of value is fully
   determined by corresponding DOF. Optionally, the prescribed value can
   be specified using ``d`` parameter. It is introduced for
   compatibility reasons. If ``prescribedvalue`` is specified, then
   ``d`` is ignored.

-  Prescribed gradient boundary condition (Dirichlet type)

   ``PrescribedGradient`` ``gradient #(rm)`` [``cCoords #(ra)``]

   Prescribes :math:`v_i = d_{ij}(x_j-\bar{x}_j)` or
   :math:`s = d_{1j}(x_j - \bar{x}_j)` where :math:`v_i` are primary
   unknowns, :math:`x_j` is the coordinate of the node, :math:`\bar x`
   is ``cCoords`` and :math:`d` is ``gradient``. The parameter
   ``cCoords`` defaults to zero. This is typical boundary condition in
   multiscale analysis where :math:`d = \partial_x s` would a
   macroscopic gradient at the integration point, i.e. this is a
   boundary condition for prolongation. It is also convenient to use
   when one wants to test a arbitrary specimen for shear.

-  Mixed prescribed gradient / pressure boundary condition (Active type)

   ``MixedGradientPressure`` ``devGradient #(ra)`` ``pressure #(rn)``
   [``cCoord #(ra)``]

   All boundary conditions of ensures that the deviatoric gradient and
   pressure is at least weakly fullfilled on the prescribed domain. They
   are used for computational homogenization of incompressible flow or
   elasticity problems.

-  Mixed prescribed gradient / pressure boundary condition (Weakly
   periodic type)

   ``MixedGradientPressureWeaklyPeriodic`` ``order #(rn)``

   Prescribes a periodic constant (unknown) stress tensor along the
   specified boundaries. For ``order`` set to 1, one obtains the same
   results as the Neumann boundary condition.

-  Mixed prescribed gradient / pressure boundary condition (Neumann
   type)

   ``MixedGradientPressureNeumann``

   Prescribes a constant (unknown) deviatoric stress tensor along the
   specified boundaries. Additional unknowns appears,
   :math:`\boldsymbol{\sigma}_\mathrm{dev}`, which is handled by the
   boundary condition itself (no control from the input file). The input
   devGradient is weakly fulfilled (homogenized over the elementsides).
   As with the the Dirichlet type, the volumetric gradient is free. This
   is useful in multiscale computations of RVE’s that experience
   incompressible behavior, typically fluid problems. In that case, the
   element sides should cover the entire RVE boundary. It is also
   convenient to use when one wants to test a arbitrary specimen for
   shear, with a free volumetric part (in which case the pressure is set
   to zero). Symmetry is not assumed, so rigid body rotations are
   removed, but translations need to be prescribed separately.

-  Mixed prescribed gradient / pressure boundary condition (Dirichlet
   type)

   ``MixedGradientPressureDirichlet``

   Prescribes
   :math:`v_i = d_{\mathrm{dev},ij}(x_j-\bar{x}_j) + d_\mathrm{vol}(x_i-\bar{x}_i)`,
   and a pressure :math:`p`. where :math:`v_i` are primary unknowns,
   :math:`x_j` is the coordinate of the node, :math:`\bar x` is
   ``cCoords`` and :math:`d_\mathrm{dev}` is ``devGradient``. The
   parameter ``cCoords`` defaults to zero. An additional unknown
   appears, :math:`d_\mathrm{vol}`, which is handled by the boundary
   condition itself (no control from the input file). This unknown is in
   a way related to the applied pressure. This is useful in multiscale
   computations of RVE’s that experience incompressible behavior,
   typically fluid problems. It is also convenient to use when one wants
   to test a arbitrary specimen for shear, with a free volumetric part
   (in which case the pressure is set to zero).

-  Nodal fluxes (loads)
   ``NodalLoad`` ``components #(ra)`` [``cstype #(in)``]
   Concentrated nodal load. The components of nodal load vector are
   given by ``components`` parameter. The size of this vector
   corresponds to a total number of nodal DOFs, and i-th value
   corresponds to i-th DOF in associated dof manager. The load can be
   defined in global coordinate system (``cstype`` = 0) or in entity -
   specific local coordinate system (``cstype`` = 1, default).

-  ``PrescribedTractionPressureBC``

   Represents pressure boundary condition (of Dirichlet type) due to
   prescribed tractions. In CBS algorithm formulation the prescribed
   traction boundary condition leads indirectly to pressure boundary
   condition in corresponding nodes. This boundary condition implements
   this pressure bc. The value of bc is determined from applied
   tractions, that should be specified on element edges/surfaces using
   suitable boundary loads.

- Linear constraint boundary condition

   ``LinearConstraintBC`` ``weights #(ra)`` [``weightsLtf #(ia)``]
   ``dofmans #(in)`` ``dofs #(in)`` ``rhs #(rn)``
   [``rhsLtf #(in)``] ``lhstype #(ia)`` ``rhsType #(ia)``

   This boundary condition implements a linear constraint in the form
   :math:`\sum_i w_ir_i = c`, where :math:`r_i` are unknowns related to
   DOFs determined by ``dofmans`` and ``dofs``, the weights are
   determined by ``weights`` and ``weightsLtf``. The constant is
   determined by ``rhs`` and ``rhsLtf`` parameters. This boundary
   condition is introduced as additional stationary condition using
   Lagrange multiplier, which is an additional degree of freedom
   introduced by this boundary condition.

   The individual DOFs are determined using dof manager numbers
   (``dofmans`` array) and corresponding DOF indices (``dofs``). The
   weights corresponding to participating DOFs are specified using
   ``weights`` array. The weights are multiplied by value returned by
   load time function, associated to individual weight using optional
   ``weightsLtf`` array. By default, all weights are set to 1. The
   constant :math:`c` is determined by ``rhs`` parameter and it is
   multiplied by the value of load time function, specified using
   ``rhsLtf`` parameter, or by 1 by default. The characteristic
   component, to which this boundary condition contributes must be
   identified using ``lhstype`` and ``rhsType`` parameters, values of
   which are corresponding to CharType enum. The left hand side
   contribution is assembled into terms identified by ``lhstype``. The
   rhs contribution is assembled into the term identified by ``rhsType``
   parameter. Note, that multiple values are allowed, this allows to
   select all variants of stifness matrix, for example. Note, that the
   size of ``dofmans``, ``dofs``, ``weights``, ``weightsLtf`` arrays
   should be equal.

.. _interactionbc:

-  InteractionBoundaryCondition 

   ``InteractionBoundaryCondition``

   Is a special boundary condition prescribed on
   InteractionPFEMParticles (see interactionparticle_
   in the PFEM part of the FluidStructureProblem. This sort of particles
   is regarded as it would have prescribed velocities, but the values
   change dynamically, as the solid part deforms. The velocities are
   obtained from coupled structural nodes.

- Body loads

   - Volume flux (load)

     | ``DeadWeight`` ``components #(ra)``
     | Represents dead weight loading applied on element volume (for
       structural elements). For transport problems, it represents the
       internal source, i.e. the rate of (heat) generated per unit volume.
       The magnitude of load for specific i-th DOF is computed as product
       of material density, corresponding volume and i-th member of
       ``components`` array.

   - Structural temperature load

     ``StructTemperatureLoad`` ``components #(ra)``

     Represents temperature loading imposed to some elements. The members
     of ``components`` array represent the change of temperature (or
     change of temperature gradient) corresponding to specific element
     strain components. See element library manual for details.

   - Structural eigenstrain load
     ``StructEigenstrainLoad`` ``components #(ra)``

     Prescribes eigenstrain (or stress-free
     strain) to a structural element. The array of ``components`` is
     defined in the global coordinate system. The number of components
     corresponds to a material mode, e.g. plane stress has three
     components and 3D six. Periodic boundary conditions can be imposed
     using eigenstrains and master-slave nodes. Consider decomposition of
     strain into average and fluctuating par
     .. math:: \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \langle \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \rangle + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^*(\boldsymbol{x})

     where :math:`\langle \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \rangle` can be imposed
     as eigenstrain over the domain and the solution gives the fluctuating
     part :math:`\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^*(\boldsymbol{x})`. Master-slave
     nodes have to interconnect opposing boundary nodes of a unit cell.

- Boundary loads
  -  Constant edge fluxes (load)

     ``ConstantEdgeLoad`` ``loadType #(in)`` ``components #(ra)``
     [``dofexcludemask #(ia)``] [``csType #(in)``]
     [``properties #(dc)``] [``propertytf #(dc)``]

   - Constant surface fluxes (load)

     ``ConstantSurfaceLoad`` ``loadType #(in)`` ``components #(ra)``
     [``dofexcludemask #(ia)``] [``csType #(in)``]
     [``properties #(dc)``] [``propertytf #(dc)``]

     Represent constant edge/surface loads or boundary conditions.
     Parameter ``loadType`` distinguishes the type of boundary condition.
     Supported values are specified in bctype.h:

     *  ``loadType`` = 2 prescribed flux input (Neumann boundary
        condition),

     *  ``loadType`` = 3 uniform distributed load or the convection
        (Newton) BC. Parameter ``components`` contains the environmental
        values (temperature of the environment) corresponding to element
        unknowns, and ``properties`` dictionary should contain value of
        transfer (convection) coefficient (assumed to be a constant) under
        the key ’a’,

      * ``loadType`` = 7 specifies radiative boundary condition
        (Stefan-Boltzmann). It requires to specify emmisivity
        :math:`\varepsilon\in\langle 0,1\rangle`, the ``components`` array
        contains the environmental values (temperature of the
        environment). Default units are Celsius. Optional parameter
        ``temperOffset`` = 0 can be used to calculate in Kelvin.


     If the boundary condition corresponds to distributed force load, the
     ``components`` array contains components of distributed load
     corresponding to element unknowns. The load is specified for all DOFs
     of object to which is associated. For some types of boundary
     conditions the zero value of load does not mean that the load is not
     applied (Newton’s type of bc, for example). Then some mask, which
     allows to exclude specific dofs is necessary. The ``dofexcludemask``
     parameter is introduced to alow this. It should have the same size as
     ``components`` array, and by default is filled with zeroes. If some
     value of dofExcludeMask is set to nonzero, then the corresponding
     componentArray is set to zero and load is not applied for this DOF.
     If the boundary condition corresponds to prescribed flux input, then
     the ``components`` array contains the components of prescribed input
     flux corresponding to element unknowns.

     The properties can vary in time. Each property can have associated
     time function which determines its time variation. The time functions
     are set up using optional ``propertytf`` dictionary, containing for
     selected properties the corresponding time function number. The time
     function must be registered under the same key as in ``properties``
     dictionary. The property value is then computed by product of
     property value (determined by ``properties``) and corresponding time
     function evaluated at given time. If no time function provided for
     particula property, a unit constant function is assumed.

     The load can be defined in global coordinate system (``csType`` = 0,
     default) or in entity - specific local coordinate system (``csType``
     = 1).

  -  Linear edge flux (load)

     ``LinearEdgeLoad`` ``loadType #(in)`` ``components #(ra)``
     [``dofexcludemask #(ia)``] [``csType #(in)``]

     Represents linear edge load. The meanings of parameters ``csType``
     and ``loadType`` are the same as for **ConstantEdgeLoad**. In
     ``components`` array are stored load components for corresponding
     unknowns at the beginning of edge, followed by values valid for end
     of edge. The load can be defined in global coordinate system
     (``csType`` = 0, default) or in entity - specific local coordinate
     system (``csType`` = 1).

  -  InteractionLoad

     ``InteractionLoad`` ``ndofs #(in)`` ``loadType #(in)``
     ``Components #(ra)`` [``csType #(in)``]
     ``coupledparticles #(ia)``

     Represents a fluid pressure induced load in the solid part of the
     FluidStructureProblem. The meanings of parameters ``ndofs``,
     ``csType``, and ``loadType`` are the same as for **LinearEdgeLoad**.
     In ``Components`` array are stored load components for corresponding
     unknowns at the beginning of edge (``ndofs`` values), followed by
     values valid for end of edge (``ndofs`` values). The load should be
     defined in global coordinate system (``csType`` = 0) as it acts in
     normal direction of the edge. Array ``coupledparticles`` assign
     PFEMParticles from the fluid part of the problem providing fluid
     pressure.

.. _InitialConditions:

Initial conditions
------------------

These records specify description of initial conditions. The general
format is following:

``InitialCondition`` ``#(in)`` ``conditions #(dc)``
The order of particular
records is optional, load, boundary or initial condition number is
determined by (``num``\ #)(in) parameter. The numbering should start
from one and should end at n, where n is the number of records. Initial
parameters are listed in ``conditions`` dictionary using keys followed
by their initial values. Now ’v’ key represents velocity and ’a’ key
represents acceleration.

.. _TimeFunctionsRecords:

Time functions records
----------------------

These records specify description of time functions, which generally
describe time variation of components during solution. The general
format is following:

``TimeFunctType`` ``#(in)`` [``initialValue #(rn)``]

The order of these records is optional, time function number is
determined by ``#(in)`` parameter. The ``initialValue`` parameter
allows to control the way, how increment of receiver is evaluated for
the first solution step. This first solution step increment is evaluated
as the difference of value of receiver at this first step and given
initial value (which is by default set to zero). The increments of
receiver in subsequent steps are computed as a difference between
receiver evaluated at given solution step and in previous step.

The numbering should start from one and should end at n, where n is the
number of records.

Currently, TimeFunctType keyword can be one from

-  Constant function

   ``ConstantFunction`` ``f(t) #(rn)``

   Represents the constant time function, with value ``f(t)``.

-  Peak function

   ``PeakFunction`` ``t #(rn)`` ``f(t) #(rn)``

   Represents peak time function. If time is equal to ``t`` value, then
   the value of time function is given by ``f(t)`` value, otherwise zero
   value is returned.

-  Piecewise function

   ``PiecewiseLinFunction`` [``nPoints #(in)`` ``t #(ra)`` ``f(t) #(ra)``] [
   ``datafile #("string")``]

   Represents the piecewise time function. The particular time values in
   ``t`` array should be sorted according to time scale. Corresponding
   time function values are in ``f(t)`` array. Value for time, which is
   not present in ``t`` is computed using liner interpolation scheme.
   Number of time-value pairs is in ``nPoints`` parameter.

   The second alternative allows reading input data from an external
   ASCII file. A hash commented line (#) is skipped during reading. File
   name should be eclosed with " ".

-  Heaviside-like time function

   ``HeavisideLTF`` ``origin #(rn)`` ``value #(rn)``

   Up to time, given by parameter ``origin``, the value of time function
   is zero. If time greater than ``origin`` parameter, the value is
   equal to parameter ``value`` value.

-  User defined

   ``UsrDefLTF`` ``f(t) #(expr)`` [``dfdt(t) #(expr)``]
   [``d2fdt2(t) #(expr)``]

   Represents user defined time function. The expressions can depend on
   “t” parameter, for which actual time will be substituted and
   expression evaluated. The function is defined using ``f(t)``
   parameter, and optionally, its first and second time derivatives
   using ``dfdt(t)`` and ``d2fdt2(t)`` parameters. The first and second
   derivatives may be required, this depend on type of analysis.

   Very general, but relatively slow.

.. _XFEMManagerRecords:

Xfem manager record and associated records
------------------------------------------

| This record specifies the number of enrichment items and simulation
  options common for all enrichment items. Functions used for enrichment
  (e.g. Heaviside, abs or branch functions) are not specified here, they
  are specified for each enrichment item separately. The same holds for
  the geometrical representation of each enrichment item (e.g. a polygon
  line or a circle). Currently, OOFEM supports XFEM simulations of
  cracks and material interfaces in 2D. The input format for the XFEM
  manager is:
| ``XfemManager`` ``numberofenrichmentitems #(in)``
  ``numberofgppertri #(in)`` ``debugvtk #(in)``
  ``vtkexport #(in)`` ``exportfields #(in)``

  where
  ``numberofenrichmentitems`` represents number of enrichment items,
  ``numberofgppertri`` denotes the number of Gauss points in each
  subtriangle of a cut element (default 12) and ``debugvtk`` controls if
  additional debug vtk files should be written (1 activates the option,
  0 is default).

| The specification of an enrichment item may consist of several lines,
  see e.g. the test *sm/xFemCrackValBranch.in*. First, the enrichment
  item type is specified together with some optional parameters
  according to
| ``EntType`` ``#(in)`` ``enrichmentfront #(in)`` ``propagationlaw #(in)``

  where ``enrichmentfront`` specifies an
  enrichment front (we may for example employ branch functions at a
  crack tip and Heaviside enrichment along the rest of the crack, hence
  the “front” of the enrichment is treated separately) and
  ``propagationlaw`` specifies a rule for crack propagation (this
  feature is still highly experimental though). Specification of an
  ``enrichmentfront`` and a ``propagationlaw`` is optional.

| The next line specifies the enrichment function to be used:
| ``EntType`` ``#(in)``

| This is followed by a line specifying the geometric description (e.g.
  a polygon line or a circle) according to
| ``EntType`` ``#(in)`` ``extra attributes``
  where the number and type of extra
  attributes to specify will vary depending on the geometry chosen, e.g.
  center and radius for a circle or a number of points for a polygon
  line.

| If an enrichment front was specified previously, the type and
  properties of the enrichment front are specified on the next line
  according to
| ``EntType`` ``#(in)`` ``extra attributes``

| If a propagation law was specified previously, it’s type and
  properties are also specified on a separate line according to
| ``EntType`` ``#(in)`` ``extra attributes``

.. _sparselinsolver:

Sparse linear solver parameters
-------------------------------

| The sparselinsolverparams field has the following general syntax:
| [``lstype #(in)``] [``smtype #(in)``] ``solverParams #(string)``
  where parameter ``lstype`` allows
  to select the solver for the linear system of equations. Currently
  supported values are 0 (default) for a direct solver (ST_Direct), 1
  for an Iterative Method Library (IML) solver (ST_IML), 2 for a Spooles
  direct solver, 3 for Petsc library family of solvers, and 4 for a
  DirectSparseSolver (ST_DSS). Parameter ``smtype`` allows to select the
  sparse matrix storage scheme. The scheme should be compatible with the
  solver type. Currently supported values (marked as “id”) are
  summarized in table linsolvstoragecompattable_. The 0
  value is default and selects the symmetric skyline (SMT_Skyline).
  Possible storage formats include unsymmetric skyline (SMT_SkylineU),
  compressed column (SMT_CompCol), dynamically growing compressed column
  (SMT_DynCompCol), symmetric compressed column (SMT_SymCompCol),
  spooles library storage format (SMT_SpoolesMtrx), PETSc library matrix
  representation (SMT_PetscMtrx, a sparse serial/parallel matrix in AIJ
  format), and DSS compatible matrix representations (SMT_DSS). The
  allowed ``lstype`` and ``smtype`` combinations are summarized in the
  table linsolvstoragecompattable_,
  together with solver parameters related to specific solver.

In case of ``ST_PETSC``, the user can set several run-time options, e.g.,
   ``-ksp\_type`` ``[cg, gmres, bicg, bcgs]``
   ``-pc\_type`` ``[jacobi, bjacobi,none,ilu,...]``
   ``-ksp\_monitor`` ``-ksp\_rtol #`` ``-ksp\_view`` ``-ksp\_converged_reason``.
   These options will override those that are default (PETSC KSPSetFromOptions() routine is called after any other customization
   routines).}

The ``stype`` allows to select particular iterative solver from IML
library, currently supported values are 0 (default) for
Conjugate-Gradient solver, 1 for GMRES solver. Parameter ``lstol``
represents the maximum value of residual after the final iteration and
the ``lsiter`` is maximum number of iteration for iterative solver. The
``precondattributes`` parameters contains the optional preconditioner
parameters. The ``lsprecond`` parameter determines the type of
preconditioner to be used. The possible values of ``lsprecond`` together
with supported storage schemes and their descriptions are summarized in
table precondtable_.

.. _eigensolverssection:

Eigen value solvers
-------------------

| The eigensolverparams field has the following general syntax:
| ``stype #(in)`` [``smtype #(in)``] ``solverParams #(string)``
  where parameter ``stype`` allows to
  select solver type. Parameter ``smtype`` allows to select sparse
  matrix storage scheme. The scheme should be compatible with solver
  type. Currently supported values of ``stype`` are summarized in
  table eigenvaluesolverparamtable_.

.. _dynamicloadbalancing:

| There are in general two basic factors causing load imbalance between
  individual subdomains: (i) one comming from application nature, such
  as switching from linear to nonlinear response in certain regions or
  local adaptive refinment, and (ii) external factors, caused by
  resourse realocation, typical for nondedicated cluster environments,
  where indivudual processors are shared by different applications and
  users, leading to time variation in allocated processing power. The
  load balance recovery is achieved by repartitioning of the problem
  domain and transferring the work (represented typically by finite
  elements) from one subdomain to another. This section describes the
  structure and syntax of parameters related to dynamic load balancing.
  The corresponding part of analysis record has the following general
  syntax:
| [``lbflag #(in)``] [``forcelb1 #(in)``] [``wtp #(ia)``]
  [``lbstep #(in)``] [``relwct #(rn)``] [``abswct #(rn)``]
  [``minwct #(rn)``]
  
where the parameters have following meaning:

-  ``lbflag``, when set to nonzero value activates the dynamic load
   balancing. Default value is zero.

-  ``forcelb1`` forces the load rebalancing after the first solution
   step, when set to nonzero value.

-  ``wtp`` allows to activate optional load balancing plugins. At
   present, the only supported value is 1, that activates nonlocal
   plugin, necessary for nonlocal averaging to work properly when
   dynamic load balancing is active.

-  ``lbstep`` rebalancing, if needed, is performed only every lbstep
   solution step. Default value is 1 (recover balance after every step,
   if necessary).

-  ``relwcr`` sets relative wall-clock imbalance treshold. When achieved
   relative imbalance between wall clock solution time of individual
   processors is greater than provided treshold, the rebalancing
   procedure will be activated.

-  ``abswct`` sets absolute wall-clock imbalance treshold. When achieved
   absolute imbalance between wall clock solution time of individual
   processors is greater than provided treshold, the rebalancing
   procedure will be activated.

-  ``minwct`` minimum absolute imbalance to perform relative imbalance
   check using ``relwcr`` parameter, otherwise only absolute check is
   done. Default value is 0.

At present, the load balancing support requires ParMETIS module to be
configured and compiled.

.. _errorestimators:

Error estimators and indicators
-------------------------------

The currently supported values of ``eetype`` are in table
eetypestable_.

-  EET_SEI - Represents scalar error indicator. It indicates element
   error based on the value of some suitable scalar value (for example
   damage level, plastic strain level) obtained from the element
   integration points and corresponding material model.

-  EET_ZZEE - The implementation of Zienkiewicz Zhu Error Estimator. It
   requires the special element algorithms, which may not be available
   for all element types.

   Please note, that in the actual version, the error on the element
   level is evaluated using default integration rule. For example, in
   case of ZZ error estimator, the error (L2 or energy norm) is
   evaluated from the difference of computed and “recovered” stresses,
   which are approximated using the same interpolation functions as
   displacements). Therefore, in many cases, the default integration
   rule order is not sufficient and higher integration must be used on
   elements (consult element library manual and related NIP parameter).

-  EET_CZZSI - The implementation of combined criteria: Zienkiewicz Zhu
   Error Estimator for elastic regime and scalar error indicator in
   non-linear regime.

.. _eetypestable:

.. table:: Supported error estimators and indicators.

   ========================= ==========
   Error estimator/indicator ``eetype``
   ========================= ==========
   EET_SEI                   0
   EET_ZZEE                  1
   EET_CZZSI                 2
   ========================= ==========

The sets of parameters (``errorestimatorparams`` field) used to
configure each error estimator are different

-  | ``EET_SEI``
   | [``regionskipmap #(ia)``]  ``vartype #(in)``
     ``minlim #(rn)`` ``maxlim #(rn)`` ``mindens #(rn)``
     ``maxdens #(rn)`` ``defdens #(rn)``
    [``remeshingdensityratio #(rn)``]

   -  ``regionskipmap`` parameter allows to skip some regions. The error
      is not evaluated in these regions and default mesh density is
      used. The size of this array should be equal to number of regions
      and nonzero entry indicates region to skip.

   -  ``vartype`` parameter determines the type of internal variable to
      be used as error indicator. Currently supported value is 1,
      representing damage based indicator.

   -  If the indicator value is in range given by parameters
      (``minlim``, ``maxlim``) then the proposed mesh density is
      linearly interpolated within range given by parameters
      (``mindens``, ``maxdens``). If indicator value is less than value
      of ``minlim`` parameter then value of ``defdens`` parameter is
      used as required density, if it is larger than ``maxlim`` then
      ``maxdens`` is used as required density.

   -  ``remeshingdensityratio`` parameter determines the allowed ratio
      between proposed density and actual density. The remeshing is
      forced, whenever the actual ratio is smaller than this value.
      Default value is equal to 0.80.

-  | ``EET_ZZEE``
   | [``regionskipmap #(ia)``]  ``normtype #(in)``
     ``requirederror #(rn)`` ``minelemsize #(rn)``

   -  ``regionskipmap`` parameter allows to skip some regions. The error
      is not evaluated in these regions and default mesh density is
      used. The size of this array should be equal to number of regions
      and nonzero entry indicates region to skip.

   -  ``normtype`` Allows select the type of norm used in evaluation of
      error. Default value is to use L2 norm (equal to 0), value equal
      to 1 uses the energy norm.

   -  ``requirederror`` parameter determines the required error to
      obtain (in percents/100).

   -  minelemsize parameter allows to set minimum limit on element size.

-  EET_CZZSI - combination of parameters for EET_SEI and EET_ZZEE; the
   in elastic regions are driven using EET_SEI, the elastic are driven
   by EET_ZZEE.

.. _materialinterfaces:

Material interfaces
-------------------

The material interfaces are used to represent and track the position of
various interfaces on fixed grids. Typical examples include free
surface, evolving interface between two materials, etc. Available
representations include:

======== ====== =============
MI       miflag Compatibility
======== ====== =============
LEPlic   0      2D triangular
LevelSet 1      2D triangular
======== ====== =============

-  | LEPlic- representation based on Volume-Of-Fluid approach; the
     initial distribution of VOF fractions should be specified for each
     element (see element manual)
   | [``refvol #(rn)``]

   -  parameter ``refvol`` allows to set initial volume of reference
      fluid, then the reference volume is computed in each step and
      printed, so the accuracy and mass conservation can be monitored.

-  | LevelSet- level set based representation
   | ``levelset #(ra)`` OR ``refmatpolyx #(ra)`` ``refmatpolyy #(ra)``
   | [``lsra #(in)``] [``rdt #(rn)``] [``rerr #(rn)``]

   -  ``levelset`` allows to specify the initial level set values for
      all nodes directly. The size should be equal to total number of
      nodes within the domain.

   -  Parameters ``refmatpolyx`` and ``refmatpolyy`` allow to initialize
      level set by specifying interface geometry as 2d polygon. Then
      polygon describes the initial zero level set, and level set values
      are then defined as signed distance from this polygon. Positive
      values are on the left side when walking along polygon. The
      parameter ``refmatpolyx`` specifies the x-coordinates of polygon
      vertices, parameter ``refmatpolyy`` y-corrdinates. Please note,
      that level set must be initialized, either using ``levelset``
      parameter or using ``refmatpolyx`` and ``refmatpolyy``.

   -  Parameter ``lsra`` allows to select level set reinitialization
      algorithm. Currently supported values are 0 (no
      re-initialization), 1 (re-initializes the level set representation
      by solving
      :math:`d_{\tau} = S(\phi)(1-\vert\boldsymbol{\nabla}d\vert)` to
      steady state, default), 2 (uses fast marching method to build
      signed distance level set representation).

   -  Parameters ``rdt`` ``rerr`` are used to control reinitialization
      algorithm for ``lsra`` = 0. ``rdt`` allows to change time step of
      integration algorithm and parameter ``rerr`` allows to change
      default error limit used to detect steady state.

.. _meshpackages:

Mesh generator interfaces
-------------------------

The mesh generator interface is responsible to provide a link to
specific mesh generator. The supported values of ``meshpackage``
parameter are

-  MPT_T3D: ``meshpackage`` = 0. T3d mesh interface. Default. Supports
   both 1d, 2d (triangles) and 3d (tetrahedras) meshes. Reliable.

-  MPT_TARGE2: ``meshpackage`` = 1. Interface to Targe2 2D mesh
   generator.

-  MPT_SUBDIVISION: ``meshpackage``\ =3. Built-in subdivision algorithm.
   Supports triangular 2D and tetrahedral 3D meshes. Can operate in
   parallel mode.

.. _InitModulesSec:

Initialization modules
----------------------

| Initialization modules allow to initialize the state variables using
  data previously computed by external software. The number of
  initialization module records is specified in analysis record using
  ``ninitmodules`` parameter (see the initial part of section
  AnalysisRecord_. The general format is the following:

| ``EntType``   ``initfile #(string)``
  The file name following the keyword
  “initfile” specifies the path to the file that contains the
  initialization data and should be given without quotes.

Currently, the only supported initialization module is

-  Gauss point initialization module

   | ``GPInitModule`` ``initfile #(string)``
   |
   | -  Each Gauss point is represented by one line in the initialization file.
   | -  The Gauss points should be given in a specific order, based on the
        element number and the Gauss point number, in agreement with the
        mesh specified in later sections.

   |-  Each line referring to a Gauss point should contain the following data:
        ``elnum #(in)`` ``gpnum #(in)`` ``coords #(ra)``
        ``ng #(in)`` ``var_1_id #(in)`` ``values_1 #(ra)`` ``...`` ``var_ng_id #(in)`` ``values_ng #(ra)``

       -  ``elnum`` is the element number

       -  ``gpnum`` is the Gauss point number

       -  ``coords`` are the coordinates of the Gauss point

       -  ``ng`` is the number of groups of variables that will follow

       -  ``var_1_id`` is the identification number of variable group number
           1 (according to the definitions in internalstatetype.h)

       -  ``values_1`` are the values of variables in group number 1

       -  ``var_ng_id`` is the identification number of variable group number ng

       -  ``values_ng``  are the values of variables in group number ng

   -  | Example:
      |   ``37 4 3 0.02 0.04 0.05 3 52 1 0.23 62 1 0.049 1 6 0 -2.08e+07 0 0 0 0``
          means that Gauss point number 4 of element number 37 has
         coordinates :math:`x=0.02`, :math:`y=0.04` and :math:`z=0.05`
         and the initial values are specified for 3 groups of variables;
         the first group (variable ID 52) is of type IST_DamageScalar
         (see internalstatetype.h) and contains 1 variable (since it is a
         scalar) with value 0.23;
         the second group (ID 62) is of type IST_CumPlasticStrain and
         contains 1 variable with value 0.049;
         the third group is of type IST_StressTensor and contains 6
         variables (stress components :math:`\sigma_x`, :math:`\sigma_y`,
         etc.) with values 0, -2.08e+07, 0, 0, 0, 0

.. _ExportModulesSec:

Export modules
--------------

| Export modules allow to export computed data into external software
  for post-processing. The number of export module records is specified
  in analysis record using ``nmodules`` parameter (see the initial part
  of section AnalysisRecord_. The general format is the
  following:
| ``EntType`` [``tstep_all``] [``tstep_step #(in)``] [``tsteps_out #(rl)``]
  [``subtsteps_out #(in)``] [``domain_all``]
  [``domain_mask #(in)``] [``regionsets #(ia)``]
  [``timeScale #(rn)``]

| To select all solution steps, in which output will be performed, use
   ``tstep_all``. To select each ``tstep_step``-nth step, use
   ``tstep_step`` parameter. In order to select only specific solution
   steps, the ``tsteps_out`` list can be specified, supplying solution step
   number list in which output will be done. To select output for all
   domain of the problem the ``domain_all`` keyword can be used. To select
   only specific domains, ``domain_mask`` array can be used, where the
   values of the array specify the domain numbers to be exported. If the
   parameter ``subtsteps_out`` = 1, it turns on the export of intermediate
   results, for example during the substepping or individual equilibrium
   iterations. This option requires support from the solver.

The export is done on region basis, on each region, the nodal
   recovery is performed independently and results are exported in a
   separate piece. This allows to take into account for
   discntinuities, or to export variables defined only by particular
   material model. The region volumes are defined using sets
   containing individual elements. By default the one region is
   created, containing all element in the problem domain. The
   optional parameter ``regionsets`` allows to use user-defined. The
   individual values refer to numbers (ids) of domain sets. Note,
   that regions are determined solely using elements.

   vtkxml tstep_all cellvars 1 46 vars 1 1 primvars 1 1 stype 2
   regionsets 2 1 2

Optional parameter ``timeScale`` scales time in output. In transport problem, basic
   units are seconds. Setting timeScale = 2.777777e-4 (=1/3600.)
   converts all time data in vtkXML from seconds to hours.


Currently, the supported export modules are following

-  VTK export, **DEPRECATED - Use VTKXML**

   ``vtk`` [``vars #(ia)``] [``primvars #(ia)``] [``cellvars #(ia)``]
   [``stype #(in)``] [``regionstoskip #(ia)``]

   ``vtkxml`` [``vars #(ia)``] [``primvars #(ia)``] [``cellvars #(ia)``]
   [``ipvars #(ia)``] [``stype #(in)``] 

   -  The vtk module is obsolete, use vtkxml instead. Vtkxml allows to
      export results recovered on region by region basis and has more
      features.

   -  The array ``vars`` contains identifiers for those internal
      variables which are to be exported. These variables will be
      smoothed and transfered to nodes. The id values are defined by
      InternalStateType enumeration, which is defined in include file
      “src/oofemlib/internalstatetype.h”.

   -  The array ``primvars`` contains identifiers of primary variables
      to be exported. The possible values correspond to the values of
      enumerated type UnknownType, which is again defined in
      “src/oofemlib/unknowntype.h”. Please note, that the values
      corresponding to enumerated type values start from zero, if not
      specified directly and that not all values are supported by
      particular material model or analysis type.

   -  The array ``cellvars`` contains identifiers of constant variables
      defined on an element (cell), e.g. a material number. Identifier
      numbers are specified in “src/oofemlib/internalstatetype.h”.

   -  The array ``ipvars`` contains identifiers for those internal
      variables which are to be exported. These variables will be
      directly exported (no smoothing) as point dataset, where each
      point corresponds to individual integration point. A separate vtu
      file for these raw, point data will be created. The id values are
      defined by InternalStateType enumeration, which is defined in
      include file “src/oofemlib/internalstatetype.h”.

   -  The parameter ``stype`` allows to select smoothing procedure for
      internal variables, which is used to compute nodal values from
      values in integration points. The supported values are :math:`0`
      for simple nodal averageing (generally supported only by
      triangular and tetrahedral elements), :math:`1` for Zienkiewicz
      Zhu recovery (default), and :math:`2` for Superconvergent Patch
      Recovery (SPR, based on least square fitting).

   
-  VTK pfem (particle FEM) export. Exports particle positions to vtk as a point dataset.

   ``vtkpfem`` [``vars #(ia)``] [``primvars #(ia)``] [``cellvars #(ia)``]
   [``ipvars #(ia)``] [``stype #(in)``] 

-  VTK memory export. This module is not producing any output, but prepares necessary data structures to suport vtk export or vtk visualization. It is used by Python interface to access vtk datasets.   
  
   ``vtkmemory`` [``vars #(ia)``] [``primvars #(ia)``] [``cellvars #(ia)``] [``ipvars #(ia)``] 

-  VTK xfem export module. Exports xfem related data. The data exported are determined
   by XfemManager vtkExportFields parameter (see ``exportfields`` keyword).

   ``vtkxmlxfem``   

-  Homogenization of IP quantities in the global coordinate system (such
   as stress, strain, damage, heat flow). Corresponding IP quantities
   are summed and averaged over the volume. It is possible to select
   region sets from which the averaging occurs. The averaging works for
   all domains with an extension to trusses. A truss is considered as a
   volume element with oriented stress and strain components along the
   truss axis. The transformation to global components occurs before
   averaging.

   ``hom`` ``ists #(ia)``   [``scale #(rn)``] [``regionSets #(ia)``]
   [``strain_energy``]

   -  An integer array ``ists`` specifies internal state types for
      export which are defined in internalstatetype.h file.

   -  The parameter ``scale`` multiplies all averaged IP quantities.
      ``scale``\ =1 by default.

   -  An integer array ``regionSets`` specifies region sets for
      averaging. All domain is averaged by default.

   -  ``strain_energy`` calculates strain energy over selected elements
      (defined by sets) by

      .. math:: W^*=\int_V \int \sigma \mathrm{d} (\varepsilon-\varepsilon_{eig}) \mathrm{d} V

      where :math:`\sigma` is the stress tensor, :math:`\varepsilon`
      stands for the strain tensor and :math:`\varepsilon_{eig}` is
      eigenstrain tensor (originates from temperature load or prescribed
      eigenstrain). Strain energy increment and total strain energy is
      reported in each step. The integration uses mid-point rule for
      stress and yields exact results for linear elastic materials.

-  Gauss point export is useful if one needs to plot a certain variable
   (such as damage) as a function of a spatial coordinate using tools
   like gnuplot. It generates files with data organized in columns, each
   row representing one Gauss point. In this way, one can plot e.g. the
   damage distribution along a one-dimensional bar.
   ``gpexportmodule`` [``vars #(ia)``] [``ncoords #(in)``]

   -  The array ``vars`` contains identifiers for those internal
      variables which are to be exported. The id values are defined by
      InternalStateType enumeration, which is defined in include file
      “src/oofemlib/internalstatetype.h”.

   -  Parameter ``ncoords`` specifies the number of spatial coordinates
      to be exported at each Gauss point. Depending on the spatial
      dimension of the domain, the points can have one, two or three
      coordinates. If ``ncoords`` is set to -1, only those coordinates
      that are actually used are exported. If ``ncoords`` is set to 0,
      no coordinates are exported. If ``ncoords`` is set to a positive
      integer, exactly ``ncoords`` coordinates are exported. If
      ``ncoords`` exceeds the actual number of coordinates, the actual
      coordinates are supplemented by zeros. For instance, if we deal
      with a 2D problem, the actual number of coordinates is 2. For
      ``ncoords``\ =3, the two actual coordinates followed by 0 will be
      exported. For ``ncoords``\ =1, only the first coordinate will be
      exported.

   The Gauss point export module creates a file with extension “gp”
   after each step for which the output is performed. This file contains
   a header with lines starting by the symbol #, followed by the actual
   data section. Each data line corresponds to one Gauss point and
   contains the following data:

   #. element number,

   #. material number,

   #. Gauss point number,

   #. contributing volume around Gauss point,

   #. Gauss point global coordinates (written as a real array of length
      ``ncoords``),

   #. internal variables according to the specification in ``vars``
      (each written as a real array of the corresponding length).

   | Example:
     ``GPExportModule 1 tstep_step 100 domain_all ncoords 2 vars 5 4 13 31 64 65``
      
     means that the \*.gp file will be written after each 100 steps and
     will contain for each of the Gauss points in the entire domain its
     2 coordinates and also internal variables of type 4, 13, 31, 64 and
     65, which are the strain tensor, damage tensor, maximum equivalent
     strain level, stress work density and dissipated work density. Of
     course, the material model must be able to deliver such variables.
     The size of the strain tensor depends on the spatial dimension, and
     the size of the damage tensor depends on the spatial dimension and
     type of model (e.g., for a simple isotropic damage model it will
     have just 1 component while for an anisotropic damage model it may
     have more). The other variables in this example are scalars, but
     they will be written as arrays of length 1, so the actual value
     will always be preceded by “1” as the length of the array. Since
     certain internal variables have the meaning of densities (per unit
     volume or area, again depending on the spatial dimension), it is
     useful to have access to the contributing volume of the Gauss
     point. The product of this contributing volume and the density
     gives an additive contribution to the total value of the
     corresponding variable. This can be exploited e.g. to evaluate the
     total dissipated energy over the entire domain.

Beam structure
--------------

This example for a simple beam structure gives basic overview of the
input file (found under tests/sm/beam2d_1.in). Structure geometry and
its constitutive and geometrical properties are shown in Fig.
(ex01_). The linear static analysis is required, the influence
of shear is neglected.

.. [1]
   Hovewer, the problem does not support the changes of static system.
   But it is possible to apply direct displacement control without
   requiring BC applied (see nrsolver documentation). Therefore it is
   possible to combine direct displacement control with direct load
   control or indirect control.
