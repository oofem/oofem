/**
 * This base class is an abstraction for numerical algorithm.
 *
 * Generally, the particular instances (instances of derived
 * classes) perform some sequence of numerical operations on given data
 * to obtain the solution.
 * The derived class should declare the interface for specific problem type
 * (like solution of linear system). The interface usually consist in
 * declaring virtual abstract function solve, with parameters corresponding
 * to problem under consideration. The solve method should return
 * value of ConvergedReason type. (Other parameters can be provided via instanciateFrom
 * service, which receives the init record of Engng method).
 * The data are specified using parameters passed to solve method (so called
 * mapping). Typically, each particular Engng model instance is responsible
 * for mapping of its governing equation components to corresponding
 * numerical components. Such mapping allows the numerical method implementation
 * to be independent of a particular physical problem by strictly dealing
 * with numerical components, which are mapped to corresponding physical
 * components of governing equation, that are  hidden to numerical method.
 *
 * It should be pointed out, that all numerical methods solving the same
 * numerical problem use the same compulsory names for the corresponding numerical components - this is
 * enforced by using the same base problem-specific class.
 * It is therefore possible to use any suitable
 * instance of the NumericalMethod class to the solve problem, and leave the whole engineering model code,
 * including mapping, unchanged, because all instances of the Numerical
 * method class provide the common interface.
 * Similarly, a high-level numerical method instance may use services of another
 * low-level numerical method instance. The numerical method
 * instance may also represent interface to an existing procedure
 * written in C or Fortran.
