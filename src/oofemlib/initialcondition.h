 * Class implementing general initial condition. Initial condition is usually attribute of
 * one or more degrees of freedom (DOFs).
 *
 * The inherited attribute 'componentArray' is not used. It is replaced with
 * the more adequate dictionary 'initialValueDictionary', which entries are
 * referenced by names rather than by indices.
 *
 * One particular DOF (with its physical meaning - for example displacement)
 * can have associated only single initial condition.
 * Initial condition therefore must represent several initial conditions for particular DOF
 * (for example velocity and acceleration of unknown can be prescribed using single
 * initial condition instance). These multiple entries are distinguished by their ValueModeType value.
 * The ValueModeType value is also used as key in initialValueDictionary.
 *
 * Initial conditions apply and should be taken into account
 * only in one particular time step, which number is determined from engineering model
 * giveNumberOfTimeStepWhenIcApply service.
 * If in this time step both boundary condition on unknown and also initial condition
 * on value of this unknown (TotalMode ValueModeType) are prescribed, then
 * always value reported by boundary condition is taken into account.
 * @see EngngModel::giveNumberOfTimeStepWhenIcApply
