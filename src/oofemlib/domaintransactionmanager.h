/**
 * Class representing domain transaction manager. The purpose of this class is to
 * make the domain modification in terms of adding and deleting components) possible.
 *
 * The changes are recorded in transaction manager and until the are committed,
 * no change is reflected in domain itself.
 *
 * When adding a new component has to be created and send as transaction parameter.
 * The allocated component will be further maintained (and deallocated) in transaction manager or domain itself.
 * When adding component a reference to already existing as well as newly added (but not yet committed)
 * component must be possible. Therefore, the concept of temporary numbering is introduced.
 * Existing domain components are assigned with temporary numbers equal to to their local numbers
 * (in parallel version to their global numbers) and newly added components can be assigned with
 * arbitrary temporary number (but which should be different from those already used). Then references
 * between components for newly added components is specified using temporary numbering.
 * After transactions are committed, the local numbering can change.
 *
 * The user is responsible for data consistency, so for example if a node is removed,
 * but an element exist that needs such node, then (hopefully)
 * an error will be thrown since there is no mechanism for enforcing data consistency.
 *
 * Transaction manager provides an access to recorded transactions; so it is possible
 * to modify an existing transaction instead of posting a new one.
 * However, transaction manager does not provides access to original unmodified domain components,
 * since this can lead to their modification and since in the current implementation the transaction
 * manager keeps only modified records, the original records are not returned. They must be requested from original domain,
 * so it is clear that their modification is not part of transaction but it directly changes domain data.
