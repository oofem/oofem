/**
 * Base abstract class representing cross section in finite element mesh.
 *
 * The main idea, why cross section has been introduced, is to hide all details
 * of cross section description from particular element. Generally elements
 * do not communicate directly with material but communicate through cross section interface,
 * which therefore can perform necessary integration (for example over layers of fibers).
 *
 * The cross section returns properties like thickness and area.
 *
 * The derived classes are supposed to be base cross section classes for particular
 * type of analysis. They should declare general interface methods necessary.
 *
 * In particular cross section implementation, where is necessary to perform integration
 * over cross section volume (over layers, fibers, ...) and therefore generally one must keep
 * complete load history in these integration points, the concept of master-slave integration
 * points should be used.
 *
 * Integration point generally can contain list of slave integration points
 * therefore is called as master point. Slaves are used for example to implement
 * layered or fibered cross sections by cross section class. Then in one
 * "macro" master Gauss point, cross section creates few slaves (one per layer)
 * and puts them into master list. When cross sections completes requests for
 * particular master integration point, it performs integration over layers.
 * It therefore calls material class for each layer, sending corresponding
 * slave as parameter and integrates results.
 * @see GaussPoint class for more detail.
