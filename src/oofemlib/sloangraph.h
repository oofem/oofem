 * Graph representing the undirected graph used for Sloan algorithm for symmetric matrix profile

 * Sloan, S., W: An algorithm for profile and wavefront reduction of sparse matrices, IJNME, vol. 23, 239-251, 1986
 * Sloan, S., W: A Fortran program for profile and wavefront reduction, IJNME, vol. 28, 2651-2679, 1989.
 * The current implementation undergoes the description of algorithm given in second paper.
 *
 * The rigid arm nodes and slave dofs are supported. A fictitious element (graph edge) connecting corresponding slave and
 * master nodes is added to reflect the connection.
 *
 * The current implementation allows to select quality.
 * The recommended value for quality is Good, causing Sloan pseudo-peripheral node selection algorithm is used.
 * The Best causes the level structure to be generated for all nodes and selecting the best one.
 * However, this is extremely time consuming.
