 * Abstract base class for all boundary conditions of problem.
 * Boundary condition is an attribute of the domain (it belongs to).
 * General BC is also attribute of several elements, nodes, Dofs and so on,
 * which are subjected to boundary condition.
 *
 * This base class only declares itself as a base class of all boundary conditions,
 * and declares only very basic services. This base class introduces
 * 'TimeFunction' as an attribute of each boundary condition.
 * 'TimeFunction' represent time variation, its value is dependent on time step.
 * The value (or the components) of a boundary condition (load) will be
 * the product of its value by the value of
 * the associated load time function at given time step.
 * The meaning of boundary condition components is dependent on particular boundary condition type,
 * and should be defined in derived classes documentation.
 *
 * This base class introduces also two general services for requesting  boundary condition physical meaning and
 * boundary condition geometrical character (pointwise, acting on element body or edge and so on).
 *
 * Derived classes should represent the base classes for particular boundary condition type (like
 * force load, or boundary condition prescribed directly on some dof) and should declare
 * the basic common interface.
