 * to filter its output using following modes:
 * - All component can be selected.
 * - Particular component can be selected.
 *   Particular time steps can be selected by specifying their list or by specifying outputStep - the each n-th
 *   step will be selected starting from firstStep (see engngModel).
 *   Particular dofmanagers and elements can be selected by specifying their list. The member of list can be
 *   component number or range of component numbers.
 * - Particular components can be excluded from selection.
 *
 * The output will be done for particular component if it is selected and is not excluded.
 * The output for given time step is done only if this step is selected by one of above
 * described method. The output for dofmanagers and elements in given step is done only if
 * particular time step is selected and if particular dofmanager or element is selected.
