/**
 * The class representing the general material model mapping algorithm.
 * The basic task is to map the selected internal variable from old mesh to specific integration point
 * on new mesh.
 * Unfortunately, there are two principal ways how to implement adaptive mapping:
 * 1) The material service is called for each IP to perform all mappings. The mapper object is used (created locally
 * or class object) to map all necessary variables. The problem is that some mappers can be used efficiently if
 * they are initialized for specific position and then they can be reused for all internal variables. The others,
 * however, are efficient if if they are initialized for certain variable (of smoothing type) and then are used
 * for all possible points. This is the key problem, whether to initialize mapper for position or for variable first.
 * This also prevents to create some general efficient interface.
 * 2) The other possibility is to make mapper object responsible for mapping variables in all IPs of material model.
 * Mapper is responsible for mapping required variables, which are specified. The advantage is, that mapper can decide,
 * whether to initialize yourself for certain variable and map all points or initialize for given point and map all
 * necessary variables. Such approach allows efficient handling of the problem, but some additional support is
 * required: there must exists standard way, how to access and update required history variable, elements must provide
 * access to all integration points, and there is another tradeoff - mapper should perform loop only over
 * elements belonging to corresponding material model and there is no efficient support for this at this time.
 *
 * The idea used here is to use option (1):  material model is responsible. The mappers are all assumed to
 * require first initialization for all variables in given point. So the mappers requiring the initialization
 * based on position can ignore given variable list and can setup for given position. The mappers requiring
 * variable init must in general support initialization for multiple variables, but even if this operation is global, i.e.,
 * recovered variables are computed in whole domain, they should be kept, since other gp's will have typically the same requests.
 * This also assumes that all mappers are are stored as class variables of material model in order to reuse
 * their initialization.
