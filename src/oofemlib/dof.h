/**
 * Abstract class Dof represents Degree Of Freedom in finite element mesh.
 * DOFs are possessed by DofManagers (i.e, nodes, sides or whatever) and
 * one DOF belongs to only one DofManager.
 * Dof maintain its related equation or prescribed equation number.
 * This equation number is usually assigned by EngngModel, however, several
 * numbering schemes can exists (see giveEquationNumber and similar services).
 *
 * It maintains also its physical meaning and reference to
 * related DofManager (reference to DofManager which possess particular DOF).
 * To describe physical meaning of particular Dof, special enum type DofId has
 * been introduced (see cltypes.h). This type is more descriptive than
 * UnknownType, which determines physical meaning for unknowns generally
 * (displacement or temperature). DofId type must distinguish between
 * dofs having displacement unknown, but in different directions, because
 * only some of these may be required by elements.
 *
 * Dof can be subjected to boundary (BC) or initial (IC) condition. Method for
 * obtaining corresponding DOF unknown value is provided. If no IC condition
 * has been given, zero value IC is assumed otherwise when needed.
 *
 * Dof class generally supports changes of static system during computation.
 * This feature generally leads to equation renumbering. Then because equation number
 * associated to dof may change, it may become extremely complicated to ask EngngModel
 * for unknown from previous time step (because equation number may have been changed).
 * To overcome this problem, derived class will implement so called unknown dictionary,
 * which is updated after finishing each time step and where unknowns for particular
 * dof are stored. Dof then uses this dictionary for requests for unknowns instead of
 * asking EngngModel for unknowns. Unknowns in dof dictionary are updated by EngngModel
 * automatically (if EngngModel supports changes of static system) after finishing time
 * step.
