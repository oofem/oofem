 * This class implements Adaptive Non-LinearStatic Engineering problem.
 *
 * Solution of this problem is performed  as a series of increments (loading or displacement).
 * At start of Each increment we assemble new tangent stiffness, and iteratively trying
 * to fulfill balance of external and real internal forces
 * at end of load step (see numerical method ).
 *
 * The error is estimated at the end of each load increment, and based on reached error,
 * the computation continues, or remeshing happens. The solution is then mapped to
 * new mesh. The solution may be taken from current state or if error is too high then is
 * taken from previous equilibrium state.
 *
 * Tasks:
 * - Creating Numerical method for solving nonlinear problem.
 * - Assembling tangent stiffness matrix
 * - Interfacing Numerical method to Elements
 * - Managing time steps
