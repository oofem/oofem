This directory contains sources to generate OOFEM bindings to Python programming language.
Currently, Python version 3.x is supported, small changes are required for old Python 2.x.
The boost.python library is required to be installed.

To compile oofem python module, set "USE_PYTHON_BINDINGS" to "ON" when configuring 
oofem target using cmake. Also, if needed, set corresponding -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE
-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and -DPYTHON_LIBRARY. This is useful when more Python versions are available.


For testing the bindings, the liboofem.so file must be somewhere where python looks for
modules. This can be done e.g. by symlinking to the .so in the build directory by 
running something like

    ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/liboofem.so /home/user/oofem-build/liboofem.so

This will make sure the module is always up-to-date with the build tree. Running
``python test3.py`` in the bindings/python directory will run a simple test which
runs an oofem simulation (heat transfer) and then iterates over DoFs and reads out
some temperature values.
