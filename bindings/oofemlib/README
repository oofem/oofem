The sources in this directory illustrate the use of oofemlib from external C/C++ applications.
beam2d_1.C    ->   2d beam example (see InputManual, section examples for reference)

You may try following compilation and linking on Linux machines, demonstrating the concept. The
prerequisite is existent library liboofem.so (in this case located under ../../default)

Compilation:
g++ -c -I../../src/oofemlib -I../../src -I../../default beam2d_1.C -o beam2d_1.o

Linking:
g++ beam2d_1.o -L../../default -loofem -o beam2d_1

Running (you may need to create a symlink to liboofem.so to current directory):
./beam2d_1

Sometimes, it is necessary to specify path to shared library explicitly
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
