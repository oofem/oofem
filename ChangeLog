	* Added support fo adaptive, parallel jobs with dynamic load
	balancing.

	* New subdivision algorithm for serial and parallel remeshing of
	tetrahedral and tringular meshes.

	* Added general xfem support. Introduced new classes representing
	global enrichment functions, their geometry description,
	integration rules, etc. New xfem manager class managing ang
	wrapping xfem stuff.

	* Added support for element insertion/removal during
	analysis. This option allows to activate/deactivate any element at
	any solution step, based on the value of load time function, that
	can be specified for every element. Very useful tool to model
	construction process, excavation, and similar processes. Enabled
	only for structural elements.

	* Support for arbitrary component numbering. Dof managers (nodes)
	and elements can have arbitrary, noncontinuous numbering.

	* Introduced new concept of random field geneartors. They are part
	of the domain and can be used to generate random field
	distributions. Also introduced random material interface, allowing
	to maintain a unique copy of any material parameter in every
	integration point. This allows to avoid a large number of material
	models, that are needed otherwise. These values can be generated
	by random or other generators, that are now attributes of a domain

	support for region-by region export. New xml based vtk export
	module.

2008-03-02  Borek Patzak  <Borek.Patzak@fsv.cvut.cz>

	* New installation and compilation procedure implemented. Now uses
	"targets", representing set of specific settings to produce target
	executable. Targets allow to set up specific compilers, compiler
	options, include different external libraries, etc. Arbitrary
	number of targets can be configured and built. In order to compile
	solver (oofem), its parallel version (poofem) and graphics
	post-processor (oofeg) you have to set up three different
	targets. The project directory structure has been altered. The new
	installation instructions as well as directory structure are
	described in README file.

	* Implemented generic dynamic load balancing framework for
	parallel jobs. Most of the time has been devoted to development of
	framework general structure and corresponding fundamental
	algorithms. Despite this, this framework is ready to use for
	nonlinear static computations. Active development is scheduled for
	upcoming versions in this direction.

	* Corrected implementation of orthotropic material, now uses major
	Poisson's ratios (submitted by Douglas Beaton). Improved and
	enhanced corresponding documentation entry.

	* Added implementation of 2D and 3D level set algorithm for
	tracking evolving interfaces.

	* Added b-bar lspace element (lspacebb) for incompressible
	problems

	* Added InputRecord giveField method allowing to read FloatMatrix
	values directly.

	* Added set of new macros allowing to declare enum types and
	automatically generate function returning string representation of
	enum value. Implementation is inspired by X-Macros technique, as
	described in Wikipedia entry on C
	preprocessor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) Some
	frequently used enums converted to new style and new string to
	enum conversions are used in many error reporting sections
	throughout the modified sources. Also vtk export module uses this
	technique to tag exported fields using their real names instead of
	integer numbers.

	* Fixed PETSc error in linear static when negative code numbers
	encountered. Used VecSetOption call to ignore negative indices.

	* Scaling of dof manager loading in assembly operations
	implemented in general service at Engng model level. Individual
	implementations at particular engng models consequently removed.

	* Fixed major bug causing invalid assembly of symmetric DSS sparse
	matrices (SMT_DSS_sym_LDL and SMT_DSS_sym_LL). The unsymmetric
	variant SMT_DSS_unsym_LU has been assembled correctly.

	* Fixed - char pointers in error and warning reporting methods
	made const to remove compiler warnings of new gcc (4.2.2), related
	to conversions from string to char*

	* Consolidated LinSystSolverType, particularly removed ST_CG and
	ST_GMRES values, which are replaced by a single ST_IML value. The
	values of this type should be related not to specific solvers, but
	more likely to specific packages that provide linear solver
	interface (and can offer several types of solvers under single
	interface) and which are represented by a class derived from
	SparseLinearSystemNM. The selection of particular solver from
	package should be done using keywords, related to particular
	package. The side effect is that the values of "lstype" parameter
	have changed.

	* Fixed problem in vtk export module preventing to export
	temperature field. New UnknownType value introduced for
	temperature itself, while FluxVector value scheduled for mass
	concentrations.

	* Changed prototype for VecScatterBegin() and VecScatterEnd(),
	needed to compy with PETSc 2.3.3. Added MatSetFromOptions call to
	allow runtime petsc config

	* Solution of quadratic equation in cubic modified to more careful
	floating-point implementation

	* Save&Restore context services migrated to use DataStream
	representation instead of plain FILE

	* Many minor enhancement and bug-fixes.

2006-11-02  Borek Patzak  <Borek.Patzak@fsv.cvut.cz>

	* OOFEM 1.7 released

	* Added new solution algorithm for incompressible flow using
	SUPG/PSPG stabilization and corresponding elements.
	* Added support for incompressible analysis of two immiscible
	fluids on a fixed domain in 2D, based on VOF approach. This also
	allows to analyze problems with free-surface flow.
	* Added new Direct Sparse Solver (contributed by
	R. Vondracek). Use --enable-dss when running configure.
	* Improved truss2d implementation (contributed by P. Grassl)
	that allows this element to be defined all planes, not only in xz
	plane
	* Added constitutive model for Bingham fluid
	* Fixed bug in domain.C preventing to have more initial than
	boundary conditions
	* Updated to new PETSC (petsc-2.3.2) and mpich2 (1.0.4p1) releases
	* Fixed non-linear static load assembly for shared nodes in
	parallel mode  specified on all partitions. (this is supposed to
	be easier for domain decomposition tools)
	* Simplified makefile syntax (thanks to L. Svoboda)
	* Many minor enhancement and bug-fixes.


2005-10-24  Borek Patzak  <Borek.Patzak@fsv.cvut.cz>

	* OOFEM 1.6 released

	* Released adaptive framework. This includes new classes
	representing general error estimator, remeshing criteria and mesh
	generator interface. The adaptive linear and nonlinear static
	analyses are now available (see oofemInput manual for details).
	True adaptivity with primary and internal variables transfer
	is supported. The Zienkiewicz-Zhu error estimator and error indicator are
	provided for linear and nonlinear problems. Actually supported
	only by	selected elements and material models. Adaptivity requires
	external mesh generator.
	* Implemented dynamic relaxation to serial/parallel nonlinear
	explicit dynamic, allowing to solve static tests (with
	proportional loading). This uses "optimum" load history that minimizes the inertia and damping forces.
	* Added new FM module (Fluid dynamic)
	* Added CBS algorithm for incompressible transient flow analysis
	including the constitutive model for Newtonian fluid, and linear
	2d element with equal order velocity and pressure interpolation.
	* Introduced new keywords in domain components record!  This includes
	ndofman, nelem, nmat, ncrosssect, nbc, nltf to identify number of
	domain components. See oofemInputManual for details.
	* Released implementation of MDM model (Anisotropic damage model).

	* Added exchange of reaction contributions for shared dofs. Works
	for pnldeidynamic, nlinear and linear statics.
	* Fixed contex fopen call (added "b" flag) to correctly open binary context file on non posix platforms
	* Added new IMLPrecondTypes : IML_ILU_CompRowPrec,
	IML_ILU_CompColPrec. Deleted old one IML_ILUPrec.
	* Removed plaintextdatareader.* (also from cvs) -> replaced by oofemtxtdatareader.*
	* Removed plaintextinputrecord.* (also form cvs) -> replaced by oofemtxtinputrecord.*
	* Implementation of generalized inputreader and datareder
	services; input reader is now abstract class declaring only basic
	services. Fields in particular record are identified by both
	InputFieldType value and corresponding string value, both are
	passed as arguments. Particular implementation of inputrecord can
	use the one or another to determine the requested value, and at
	the same time, the passed string is used to report possible error(s) in
	human readable form. String values are used in parsing oofem input
	files, while InputFieldType values can be used to retrieve values
	from binary files, databases, etc.
	* Updated to new petsc-2.3.0.
	* Updated to mpich-1.2.6
	* Element Class: all dof managers: nodes, sides, and internal dofs
	are now stored in single dofManArray, new attribute
	numberOfDofMans introduced, which replace old numberOfNodes and
	NumberOfSides. The new method returning numberOfNodes is
	introduced. The method returning particular node (giveNode, but
	made virtual) is preserved to allow loop only over nodes. This
	allows to introduce additional dof managers and dofs at element
	level (internal nodes, etc.) that are not condensed.
	* oofeg: the plot of beam quantities (forces/moments/strains)
	decoupled from stress/strain plot, oofeg accepts the (-l) option
	allowing to set verbose level, added visualization to libeam3d2
	elements (using markers).
	* UnknownType replaced by EquationType {ET_MomentumEq, ET_ConservationEq}
	* Added test length of maxa columns in skyline (if set to initial value, there is no stiffness for this equation)
	* Fixed error in generalized eigen value solver based on subspace iteration
	* Added new generalized eigen value solver based on inverse iteration algorithm
	* Added short docs for linear stability
	* Fixed test for end-of-file while reading raw line in oofemtxtdatareader.C
	* Added captions in output file allowing to better distinguish dofman, element, and other sections
	* Added donotfixload flag in nlinearstatic that will not fix load level after metastep termination
	* Automatic time step control in CBS
	* CBS equation can now be scaled (dimensionless support)
	* Removed win32 support


2004-04-14  Borek Patzak  <Borek.Patzak@fsv.cvut.cz>

	* OOFEM 1.5 released

	* Linear and nonlinear static analyses can be run in parallel
	(requires PETSC support).

	* Implemented serial and parallel interface to PETSC library
	(requires version 2.2 or higher; available at
	http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/). Added new configure
	option "--enable-petsc" to compile PETSC support.

	* Enhanced documentation (oofemInput, material library manual).

	* Implemented reading of records in arbitrary order (entity number
	now relevant).

	* New message and error reporting - supports different log levels,
	filtering, multiple log objects, counter for errors and warnings,
	macros for easy and consistent error and warning reporting). Added
	"-l" program option allowing to set verbosity level.

	* Added symmetry nonlocal barrier, allowing to enforce symmetry
	constraint on averaging field.

	* Added new multisurface model for masonry.

	* Added new multisurface plasticity driver (MPlasticMaterial2).

	* Added new program parameter "-c" with same meaning as -context
	(-context becomes obsolete).

	* Added stress/strain transformation procedures into stress/strain
	vectors.

	* Added line search algorithms to nonlinear solvers.

	* oofem and poofem input manuals migrated together.

	* Fixed problem in NRsolver, where for direct displacement
	control, stiffness is modified and if elastic matrix is used it
	should be reassembled for new metastep.

	* Fixed problem in NRsolver, where BC constraints were enforced
	multiple times (for any solution step) leading to loss of
	precision (too huge numbers on diagonal).

	* Splitted communicator class into separate buffer and communicator
	classes (allow sharing of buffers between several communicators).

	* Fixed the Sloan renumbering procedure to work with standalone
	nodes and separate sub-domains.

	* Many minor enhancement and bug-fixes.



2003-04-04  Borek Patzak  <Borek.Patzak at fsv.cvut.cz>

	* OOFEM 1.4 released

	* Significantly improved parsing of input files. Non-relevant
	tokens are detected and reported.

	* Added support of serial version of SPOOLES sparse direct solver
	(http://www.netlib.org/linalg/spooles/).

	* Removed obsolete macros IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC and
	DECLARE_DYNAMIC. The standard dynamic_cast and static_cast
	operators should be used instead.

	* Added support for unsymmetric stifness element matrices at
	structural element level.

	* Implemented stress and strain vectors. The keep their
	stress-strain mode (like plane stress or plane strain) and provide
	many useful services. Their purpose is to facilitate
	implementation of constitutive laws.

	* Implemented interpolation classes. The idea is to simplify the
	element implementation by providing common interpolation classes
	with corresponding services (evaluation of shape functions,
	derivatives, jacobians, transformation of global coordinates to
	local ones and vice versa, etc). The implementation of
	isoparametric interpolations is provided.

	* Upgrade of Elixir library to actual version required.
 	* Fixed problem in parallel explicit dynamics - the element load
	for shared dof managers is now properly transferred to adjacent
	subdomains.

	* Merged similar types CharTypeMode and UnknownTypeMode  into
	ValueModeType.

	* Implemented abstraction of fields. Field represent the spatial
	distribution of	certain variable. Fields are able to evaluate its
	value at any point of interest at given time.

	* Added new module for solving transport problems (tm
	directory). Current capabilities include stationary and
	transient analysis of heat and coupled heat&mass transfer
	problems for axisymmetric, two, and three dimensional cases.

	* Added tests for tm module. Test splitted into separate
	directories corresponding to particular modules.

	* Added general staggered problem, which allows to group basic problems
	together and to transfer and share the solution fields between
	basic subproblems. It allows, for example, to simultaneously solve
	heat transfer analysis and mechanical analysis, where temperature
	field generated by heat transfer anaslysis is used in mechanical
	analysis as teperature loading. Moreover, a general implementation
	allows to use different discretizations for basic subproblems.

	* IML sources excluded from basic distribution. They should be
	downloaded separately. Added configure option to include IML
	support during compilation.


2001-12-09  Borek Patzak  <Borek.Patzak at fsv.cvut.cz>

	* OOFEM 1.3 released.

	* Redesigned the input data parsing. Significantly improved
	the checking of input syntax. Missing compulsory keywords
	and syntax errors are now consistently reported. The new
	implementation (by using abstraction for input record) possibly
	allows the transparent handling of different input sources in the
	future.

	* Improved several features of postporcessor (oofeg).
	Deleting layer graphics optimized, fixed graphics flickering for
	several render modes when removing/drawing objects.

	* Implemented new efficient algorithm with significantly less
	memory requirements for internal structure allocation of
	coordinate based sparse matrices.

	* Direct displacement control now implemented by class
	NRSolver. The direct displacement control and direct load control
	are now supported. The non-linear problem can be now solved under
	direct load control, direct displacement control, indirect
	control, or their combination.

	* Added support for data export in vtk format (vtkexportmodule).
	Implemented as export module. The scalars, vectors, and symmetric
	3x3 tensors are fully supported, general tensors are exported
	component-wise as scalars.

	* Changed the concept of Engng model -> Nummet mapping. The
	derived classes from NumericalMethod should declare the interface
	for specific problem type (like solution of linear system). The
	interface now consist in declaring virtual abstract function
	solve, with parameters corresponding to class of problems under
	consideration. The solve method should return value of NM_Status
	type. (Other parameters can be provided via instanciateYourself
	service, which receives the init record of Engng method). The data
	are specified using parameters passed to solve method (so called
	mapping).

	* Directory structure modified. The library directory renamed to
	oofemlib, sm directory now treated as real module - a
	corresponding library is created. The new main directory created
	containing global "main" functions and some other global
	functions. This new structure better comply with modular design of
	oofem and allows simple addition of new modules in the future.

	* Fixed problem if there is no numerical method associated with
	e-model (nldeidynamic).

	* Fixed edge load transformation for traplanestress and
	trplanestrain elements.

	* Fixed error in evaluation of reaction forces with element load
	contribution in non-linear problems with non-proportional loading.

	* Mdm material model functionality extended to plane strain. Mdm
	model now accept latest format of input parameters.

	* Added math error handler via matherr function

	* Several changes to compile even more smoothly on different
	platforms. Fixed missing Elixir declaration of EVFastRedraw
	function. Added initialization of len variable in readQuotedString
	in strreader.C causing problems on some compilers.

No news for earlier releases.
